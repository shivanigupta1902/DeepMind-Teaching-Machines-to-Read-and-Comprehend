( @entity6 ) in his first interview since @entity4 militants burned alive a @entity1 pilot , the @entity0 of @entity1 spoke to @entity6 's @entity7 about why and how the country is going after the terror group . last december , @entity10 captured @entity13 pilot @entity11 after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the @entity18 - led coalition to defeat the group . for more than a month , @entity11 's family , hailing from a high - ranking tribe considered especially loyal to @entity1 's royal family , implored @entity10 to let him go . hope that he could be spared ended in early february when a video emerged showing the 29 - year - old pilot in a cage , being burned alive . @entity26 , an instrumental supporter of the global coalition , then said @entity1 would be relentless in retaliating against @entity10 . the country unleashed airstrikes . to @entity7 , @entity26 reiterated his commitment to stop @entity10 . he called its fighters " outlaws " who twist @entity35 and use " intimidation " as their biggest weapon . the @entity0 told @entity7 that he did n't watch the video of the pilot 's slaying . " i -- many of us refused to see what i think is propaganda , " @entity26 said . he felt " disgust , sadness for the family " and his " heart went out to the father , the mother , the brothers , the sisters , " the @entity0 continued . " his wife , they 'd only been married for five months . ( i felt ) anger as the son of the @entity58 army , @entity1 armed forces . @entity60 bless his soul . he 's a brother in arms . " all soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what @entity65 was put through , " @entity26 said . during his interview with @entity7 , the @entity0 repeatedly referred to @entity10 , the @entity10 and @entity68 , as @entity69 . that 's an acronym for @entity71 . many in the @entity73 prefer to use @entity74 because , to them , the acronym @entity10 suggests the terror group is a legitimate state . they refuse to give the militants that much credit . " i think if @entity10 , or @entity69 as we call them , try to intimidate @entity1 ... just ( has ) the reverse effect , " @entity26 said . " if you look at our history , we 're a country that 's used to being outgunned and outnumbered . we 've always punched way above our weight . i think , if anything , @entity69 has us as a tiger by the tail . " the pilot 's killing " just motivated @entity1 to rally around the flag , " he said . " the gloves have come off . " @entity10 is " always trying to intimidate , scare , put fear in people 's hearts , " the @entity0 told @entity7 . " they are trying to invent falsely a linkage to a caliphate , link to our history in @entity35 that has no truth or bearing to our history . " @entity10 is recruiting " deluded young men and women " who " think this is an @entity10 nation . " @entity18 president @entity107 has caught flak for saying he did n't want to refer to @entity10 members as @entity10 extremists because their actions are not @entity10 . " i think he is right , " @entity26 said . " this is something that has to be understood on a much larger platform . ( @entity10 ) is looking for legitimacy ( that ) they have inside of @entity35 . " " i 'm a muslim , " the @entity0 said . " these people ( @entity10 members ) ... are on the fringe of @entity35 . " " the barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero ( the pilot ) , i think , shocked the @entity35 world , especially @entity1 and people from this region , " @entity26 said . in the wake of the pilot 's death , a @entity1 government spokesman vowed an " earthshaking retaliation . " @entity7 asked @entity26 if @entity1 's action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric . " @entity134 - shattering from all military capabilities is not something that happens overnight , " he answered , saying that airstrikes have continued . " there are continued operations going on in @entity68 . we are coordinating with our friends in @entity141 . " he said there is a " long - term approach " to fighting @entity10 but did n't give any more details . the war against @entity10 is as much @entity1 's war as that of any other country in the coalition , he said . " it is our war . it has been for a long time , " he said . " these are outlaws , in a way , of @entity35 , the minute they set up this irresponsible caliphate to try to expand their dominion over @entity157 . " @entity10 can not argue that @entity1 and other @entity35 nations should not attack them because they 're fellow @entity157 , he said . the militants " try to make themselves look as victims , " he said . " what about the hundreds if not thousands of @entity157 they have killed in @entity68 and @entity141 over the past year and a half ? " @entity1 has a " responsibility to reach out to eastern @entity68 " and to western @entity141 where people have been " executed in large numbers " by @entity10 , @entity26 insisted . " so this is our war , " he said . " we have a moral responsibility to reach out to those @entity157 to protect them and stop ( @entity10 ) before they reach our border . " @entity7 asked @entity26 what he thinks about the perception some have that @entity68 president @entity173 is interested in combating @entity10 , meaning @entity173 and @entity26 have common enemies . @entity10 has gained strength by exploiting the unrest in @entity68 during its ongoing civil war . that war is the result of unrest in @entity68 that originally started in 2011 within the context of the @entity182 , protests for democracy or changes in government that raged in parts of the @entity73 and @entity188 in 2010 and 2011 . @entity68 protesters , in 2011 , wanted to bring change to the government which they said stifled expression in the harshest ways . the @entity173 regime violently cracked down on the demonstrators , chaos erupted throughout @entity68 , and eventually many on the international stage came to believe @entity173 should go . the @entity0 told @entity7 that the " history of dealing with " the @entity173 regime and the " history of dealing with " @entity10 are two separate things . " what has taken prominence at the moment is @entity10 , @entity69 , " he said . @entity26 rhetorically asked whether both issues can be dealt with at the same time . " this has to be decided by the international community , " he said . " we believe there has to be a political solution " in @entity68 , and that has " not been clarified at the moment . "
