( @entity1 ) @entity0 might be a @entity3 winner with @entity4 but at home he has a different title : managing director of carrots . that 's because his wife , @entity10 , is an aspiring dressage rider with her own designs on conquering the sport she loves . and the hours they spend at stables just outside @entity15 seem to be paying dividends , @entity10 picking up her first title at national level over the weekend . while the 25 - year - old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses , @entity0 takes a keen interest in breeding , as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to . " i come here to watch if everything 's fine , " he told @entity1 in the couple 's first joint television interview . " and for the carrots . i 'm the managing director of carrots ! i watch the dogs . sometimes i help a little bit but it 's her business . " i enjoy it a lot . they make me feel comfortable , the attitude and what they look like and [ the way they ] live their lives . it 's fun . it 's easy to relax around horses . " at 25 , @entity0 is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come . he has a glut of domestic trophies , including three @entity55 titles , and claimed the @entity57 and @entity58 crowns with @entity59 in 2013 . last year in @entity60 he landed the ultimate prize when @entity4 powered its way to a first @entity3 triumph since 1990 , memorably beating hosts @entity60 7 - 1 in the semis before edging past @entity66 in the final . but you wo n't hear much talk of that landmark moment in @entity0 's career around the stables . " he 's interested in horses so when we are together we talk about horses and not really about football , " @entity10 explained . " he knows more about horses than i know about football . " while @entity0 has enjoyed overwhelming success at an early stage in his career , @entity10 's path is a more arduous and exhaustive one . though she has been riding horses since her @entity85 introduced her to the sport aged four , it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage . and though her recent victory at the @entity91 in the @entity93 town of @entity94 shows she is clearly in tune with her horse @entity97 , @entity10 says her learning curve is a lengthy one . " you have to do eight years to learn everything but then you still do n't know everything . you always keep learning , " she said . " it 's not like other sports , you always train yourself , you have to get a harmony between the horse and yourself . " it has its own mind , its own feelings . you have to become a team and that 's why it takes so much time . every horse is different so you have to feel it . " i want to get better and better . maybe at some point i will be very good , that 's my dream . [ the @entity120 ] would be a dream . " i think for every sportsman it 's a dream and you want to reach it but just a few people can reach it . maybe , maybe not . " according to @entity10 's coach , @entity129 , that is a distinct possibility . last year 's qualification for the prestigious @entity131 -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential . " i 've never had a student that developed that fast no matter what horses they had , " @entity129 told @entity1 . " she 's got the will and she 's got the talent and she does n't stop . she keeps on working . and not so many riders have the ability and that makes her fortunate in a way . " i think she 'll be able to be successful on an international level for sure . " @entity0 is of the same opinion . though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and @entity97 . both the couple 's disciplines rely on a high skill level , but also strong communication , and though the competition is fierce , @entity0 has high hopes for the pair . " the potential is there , " he said . " he 's our best talent i think and the number one in our stable and for @entity10 . " but it 's no guarantee for success because in @entity4 there 's a lot of opponents . a lot of good riders and a lot of good other horses . like in football . " she has no pressure . i want that she 's happy with the horses , with the work and with the competitions . but it 's not easy . " it 's very tough to get up in @entity4 in the dressage sport . she needs time to develop her quality . we 're on a good way and we need to go for it . " @entity0 can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds , whether in racing or dressage circles , while some fall by the wayside . " there are some talents and they grow up and go to the top , " he said . " and some talents do n't get to the top . " it 's interesting to watch , the development of the different horses from when they come to the stable and when they leave . but he [ @entity97 ] stays for sure . " @entity0 has his own sideline at the stables too -- breeding . " breeding is a little bit for fun , " he explained . " for sure i want to breed the best horse i can . but it 's difficult and a bit of luck . but i try my best to optimize . " my dream is one day that @entity10 rides a horse that i bred . but that 's a long way to go . " though she often goes to watch @entity0 play at @entity59 's home stadium -- the @entity221 -- @entity10 does n't even remotely fit the @entity223 stereotype . the wives and girlfriends of high - profile footballers are often portrayed as carefully manicured , fashion - obsessed shopaholics -- an image cultivated by the tabloid newspapers . but @entity10 , who chose not to travel with @entity0 to the @entity3 in @entity60 last year , has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets . " i do n't , " she said . " you have the bad sides also . everyone comes and wants to get a photo , a selfie or an autograph . that would be too much . i ca n't do that like @entity0 can do it . " he 's so easy going . and i want to do my horses by myself . i can groom them the best , i can ride them the best and i love them the most . " they 're my partner , my brother . i can tell them every problem . they 're the most important part in my life . " this statement provoked a laugh from her husband : " i have already accepted it , " he joked . " maybe i 'm number five . but it 's ok . "
