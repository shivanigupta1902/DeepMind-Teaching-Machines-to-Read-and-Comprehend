( @entity0 ) there have been a few times in my career when i 've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace . no , i certainly do n't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing " @entity10 " together in the office , but i 'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me was n't , when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be , when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear , anxiety or what have you . i 'd love to say more about each of the women i 've met along the way who fit those descriptions , but my point is not to single anyone out . my goal is to ask the question , " why ? " obviously , not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior , but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up ? i figured this would be a perfect question for @entity38 , author of a new self - help book for women called " @entity41 , " and she did n't disappoint . unlocking ' @entity41 ' : 4 tips to know your value " from the time we 're little girls , we 're taught to compete , " said @entity45 during a recent conversation at @entity0 . " i need to be prettier , taller , smarter , my hair needs to be straighter , curlier , whatever it is . i need to get the better looking guy . i need to always be better than because we 're taught to come from a place of lack as women . " the way @entity45 , an award - winning author and journalist , radio and television personality and motivational speaker , sees it , we women need to start operating like the boys . men " operate from a sense of , there 's this whole pie , and i want my piece , and i do n't care if he gets his piece , and maybe we even have to work together to start that business , start that company , " said @entity45 . of course , it 's easier for a man not to worry " if he gets his piece " since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate america , but that is n't the case for women . today , just 5 % of @entity86 chief executives are women and only 14 % of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women , according to a @entity92 analysis . @entity95 teams up with @entity93 to get men to # @entity96 decades ago , the situation was even worse . when i was just starting my television news career in 1990 , women who were in their 40s and were in high - level positions were the only women in a position of influence . naturally , many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job . " because they did n't think there could be ten of them , they only thought there could be one of them , " said @entity45 . " fast forward 20 years later . now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms , a number of women in @entity121 . i could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us . " which means we can lift as we climb , we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers , says @entity45 . " how exactly do we do that ? " i had to ask . @entity45 came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other . first , @entity45 says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about " who 's in your row . " " if you hear another woman say , and i 've heard this , ' i do n't do women friends , i do n't have women friends , ' believe her and leave her alone . i mean that , listen to me now , " said @entity45 . there are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women , so do n't invest any time , if possible , with people who do n't , she says . if you are in a meeting and you have a great idea , do n't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself , said @entity45 . " collaborate , share , collaborate . ... so you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing . " competition is healthy and we can compete , but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues ' playbook , she said . " the guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of ' i want the dollars . i want to win the contract . i want to get the business . ' we have to get in that same mindset . " we 're all busy but we 've got to slow down and mentor , said @entity45 . " we have to build a bench , " she said . " men do this well again . you 've seen it in corporate , i 've seen it . the guys go out and golf . they do things together and they 're building up the next young man leader . whatever field we 're in ... we 're less likely to do it because we 're busy . we 've got to mentor . " when you lift other women as you climb , said @entity45 , you realize it 's reciprocal . " it 's not all about you . " we women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations , i added . " the right women , " said @entity45 . " i want to caveat that . and again , i do n't mean to be mean or catty but ... i know a lot of women in power positions that do n't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do . " this is a tough one for us , says @entity45 . we need to be willing to say to another woman that we did n't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up , not pulling her down . " do n't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her . you 'd be amazed at how silly we can be . we 're still in kindergarten some of us , " said @entity45 . " @entity212 is still one of the most rampant , nasty things we do as women to each other . and it hurts . it really damages women . " why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace ? share your thoughts with @entity227 on @entity228 @ kellywallacetv or @entity230 on @entity231 .
