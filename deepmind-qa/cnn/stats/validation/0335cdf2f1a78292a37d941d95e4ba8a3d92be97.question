( @entity4 ) @entity3 's abject cricket @entity1 record endures . its team has been eliminated before the group stages of the competition has even finished after a demoralizing defeat to @entity9 , who qualified for the quarterfinals . it means @entity3 , who invented the game of cricket but has never won the @entity1 , still has n't been past the last eight stage of the one - day tournament since 1992 . chasing a target of 276 off its 50 overs in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity3 slumped to 260 all out , with only @entity22 offering any meaningful resistance . the wicketkeeper struck a brisk 65 after @entity3 's top order failed to lay a platform for victory , before he was dismissed by @entity28 . @entity3 captain @entity29 failed again with the bat , lasting just three balls before succumbing to @entity32 for no score . it marks another miserable display from one of cricket 's supposed powerhouses on the world stage , its only victory in the 2015 competition coming against minnows @entity42 . whereas other teams in the tournament have taken an aggressive approach , some posting totals of over 400 , @entity3 's modus operandi has looked slovenly and outdated . " @entity50 poor to be knocked out of a @entity1 so early , it is very disappointing , " @entity29 said at the post-match presentation . " i ca n't put my finger on it at the moment . i 'm gutted . we 've struggled and fought our way since we arrived -- one of our big things was to fight hard and try to get through to the quarterfinals . " our expectations are much higher than this . i 've no idea what happens from here -- it 's a surprise we 're out this early . there will be an inquest over the next few weeks and we 'll go from there . " coach @entity67 is bound to come in for renewed criticism , and the clamor for the return of one of @entity3 's best one - day players -- @entity73 -- is sure to grow louder . @entity74 - born @entity73 was sacked after the disastrous tour to @entity21 in 2014/15 , the @entity76 saying he was a disruptive dressing room influence . " it 's a hollow feeling at the moment , " @entity67 said after @entity3 's defeat . " you feel like you have let people down . " despite committing a year to prepare for the @entity1 , @entity3 dismissed @entity83 as skipper less than two months before the tournament in @entity21 and @entity86 began . @entity87 was @entity9 's hero , scoring the country 's first ever century at the @entity1 , as it recorded one of the biggest wins in its history . @entity3 now face a dead rubber against @entity93 on friday while @entity9 has cemented its place in the last eight .
