@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) for @entity2 's economy , corn is everything . so it 's no surprise that the @entity9 governor and other powerful voices in state agribusiness are vocal backers of the @entity13 , a federal rule that requires gasoline to be comprised of up to 10 % in renewable fuels . one of those is ethanol -- with corn often a key ingredient . " do n't mess with the @entity13 , " gov. @entity21 said saturday , offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely @entity9 presidential candidates . the @entity13 is a major issue that @entity29 hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the no. 1 corn - producing state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar . but it 's a less popular policy for small government conservatives , who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector . in his first 2016 visit to @entity2 , @entity37 sought to delicately explain his desire to see the @entity13 disappear over time . " the market 's ultimately going to have to decide this , " he told the audience at the event , which took place at the @entity44 . @entity37 acknowledged that the mandate , which passed in 2007 , has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost corn - heavy economies . " but as we move forward over the long haul , there should be certainty for people to invest , " he argued , saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government . " so at some point we 'll see a reduction of the @entity13 need , because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country . " he declined , however , to suggest when exactly that may happen . in his remarks , @entity37 also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements . and while attending a fundraiser friday night in @entity1 , he stood by his support for @entity78 , the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives . election 2016 : @entity37 makes his first @entity2 foray @entity37 's frank statements on the @entity13 and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former @entity90 governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail , no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences . still , he was not totally immune to at least some pandering . @entity37 told the crowd that he 'll be cooking some " @entity2 beef " sunday when he 's back home with his family in @entity90 , adding that he 'll probably make some " really good guacamole , " too . talking about campaigning for his father 's presidential campaigns in @entity2 , @entity37 said he went to at least 50 counties . " i remember eating really well -- eating really , really well . " with a @entity106 tractor towering near the stage , each candidate sat on stage for a 20 - minute q&a with @entity110 , an agribusiness entrepreneur and major @entity9 donor in @entity2 . the audience of close to 1,200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry . while @entity37 took a mild approach to the @entity13 , sen. @entity117 of @entity119 flat out opposed it , saying @entity123 should n't be " picking winners and losers . " " i have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies , asking for special favors , " he said . " i think that 's how we got in this problem to begin win . " ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations , consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government 's support to break through oil 's stronghold of the market . @entity117 acknowledged that his view would n't be well - received , but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity . " look , i recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you 'd like me to give is , ' i 'm for the @entity13 , darn it . ' that 'd be the easy thing to do . but i 'll tell ya , people are pretty fed up , i think , with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing , tell another group another thing . " former @entity119 gov. @entity163 took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt @entity119 from the federal mandate . if individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline , that 's fine , he said , but not the federal government . " i philosophically do n't agree that @entity123 needs to be making these decision that affect ... our agriculture industry , " @entity163 said . other contenders offered entirely opposite positions . @entity180 gov. @entity179 , for example , said he " absolutely " supports the @entity13 . " that 's what the law requires . so let 's make sure we comply with the law . that should be the minimum , " he said , drawing applause from the crowd . @entity192 , who won the @entity2 caucuses in 2012 , ticked off what he called a " laundry list " of benefits , including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers . " it is very important for rural @entity203 , " said the former senator from @entity201 . for his part , @entity204 argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security . " @entity203 needs to do three things to be free : feed itself , fuel itself , fight for itself , " the former @entity210 governor said , adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened @entity203 . @entity204 , who won the @entity2 caucuses in 2008 , hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the @entity13 for political reasons . " the decisions are made not just frankly for what 's best for @entity2 -- that 's not the rationale . you ca n't make a decision and say , ' it 's good for @entity2 . @entity228 , they 're the caucus state , we better suck up to them . ' we better make decisions that are good for every consumer , " he said . @entity235 gov. @entity234 , who 's had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in january , made clear that while he 's generally a free market guy , he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance . " right now , we do n't have a free and open marketplace , and so that 's why i 'm willing to take that position , " he said . but , similar to @entity37 , @entity234 said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and " you no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies . " the audience at saturday 's event was largely subdued , given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance , less red meat . those who supported the @entity13 , however , received a strong response from the crowd . as for those who opposed it , @entity260 , who co-chairs a campaign called @entity203 's @entity262 which pushes the ethanol mandate , said he 's not ready to write anyone off quite yet . but those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months . " maybe i did n't like a few of their answers , but it 's going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues , " he said .
