( @entity3 ) with the passing of @entity2 , fans worldwide mourned the loss of the legendary performer who gave life to the @entity8 first officer on @entity9 . as @entity10 , @entity2 touched audiences with his commitment to the principles of science and logic , and his embrace of " infinite diversity in infinite combinations . " @entity2 's portrayal has inspired generations to pursue careers in space , science and technology , to embrace the uniqueness of others , and to appreciate the same in themselves . it is difficult to measure the impact of @entity2 's iconic role , particularly on the science and technology communities . for decades , many of the best and brightest inventors , explorers and engineers have credited @entity9 with sparking their imaginations . for many , @entity10 holds a sacred spot as not only one of the most beloved characters in all of science fiction , but the earliest example of @entity9 's enduring legacy of inspiring innovation in the real world . @entity10 first appeared on our television screens in 1966 with the premiere of the original @entity9 series . since then , the show has earned a reputation for predicting future technologies with remarkable accuracy . at a time when the computer age was only just beginning and the idea of handheld communication devices or tablet computers were fantasies of a far - off future , @entity10 could be seen working with many of these technologies aboard the @entity63 . as we soon discovered , his incredible tools and gadgets were n't so distant after all . soon , we moved closer to realizing these devices in our own world with the development of the integrated circuit . portable and handheld computers were suddenly possible , and some scientists turned to @entity9 for inspiration as they sought to design the next wave of modern marvels . one such scientist was @entity78 , inventor of the first mobile phone , who has credited the handheld communicators used by @entity81 and @entity10 as the source of his inspiration . even though @entity78 's original cellular telephone was n't as compact as @entity10 's , and most consumers could n't afford one for some time , it was n't long before they would become ubiquitous in our world . the same is true for the handheld computers @entity10 used to record scientific data . about the size of a notepad , and sometimes equipped with a stylus , these handy gadgets would go on to appear in every incarnation of the @entity9 franchise . they are known as @entity97 — @entity98 — and it 's hard to ignore their influence on the the real thing . from their design and function to the name of today 's most popular tablet computer , @entity10 may well have been the first @entity107 user . another technological wonder that first appeared in @entity10 's hands was known as the tricorder . this mobile scanning device could be used to take readings while on an away mission to an alien planet . this data might include atmospheric conditions , radiation levels , or even the chemical composition of an object . the version @entity2 used on set was bulky and had to be worn with a shoulder strap . however , tricorders would soon become one of the most versatile and sought - after pieces of @entity126 . today , our smartphones can deliver many features of the @entity129 , while more specialized scientific and medical instruments are able to duplicate some of the more advanced scanning capabilities . it was n't just computers and productivity gadgets that @entity10 brought to life on screen . he was often a proponent of passive resistance and non-violent solutions . along with his fellow crew mates , he presented us with new ideas like weapons " set to stun " that formed the core of the @entity9 ethos . as we still wrestle with violence in our world , today 's scientists and law enforcement are working toward breakthroughs in non-lethal weapons in an effort to prevent unnecessary loss of life . the original @entity9 series predicted or even inspired these and many other technologies in only three seasons on television . of course , the franchise would continue this tradition with four more television series and twelve movies . over the course of nearly 50 years , @entity9 has given us many more ideas that we 've realized , like touch - screen and voice - control computer interfaces , and others we have n't quite mastered yet . tech concepts like the universal translator , the holodeck , the replicator and , of course , the transporter hold the potential to radically change our world — and they might not be as far off as we think . our iphones and tablets have made touch screens commonplace , and we can communicate with @entity176 or @entity177 through voice commands just like the computer on the @entity63 ( though maybe not as effectively ) . we can instantly connect with others across great distances and even across language barriers thanks to recent advancements like @entity186 's @entity185 technology . meanwhile , 3d printers allow for on - demand fabrication of many objects , and immersive virtual reality devices may soon make holographic adventures as common as video games . scientists have even been able to transport particles of matter across distances , perhaps taking the first steps toward transporting people through space one day . as we say goodbye to @entity2 , let us remember him not only for his work as an actor on @entity9 , but for his remarkable role in the world of science and technology . through @entity10 , @entity2 challenged us to understand our human nature , including our scientific curiosity , and in the process helped inspire countless men and women to reach for the stars . this is one more way that @entity2 will be remembered , in the hearts and minds of so many scientists , helping us all to " live long and prosper .
