( @entity2 ) former @entity1 star @entity0 returned to haunt his old side to send holders @entity4 into the semifinals of the @entity6 with a 2 - 1 victory at @entity8 monday . the @entity10 striker was surplus to requirements at @entity12 's @entity1 , but was quick to capitalize on a mistake by @entity14 to grab the winner just after the hour mark . a disappointing night for @entity1 was compounded by a late red card for @entity19 international @entity18 , who was given his marching orders after manhandling referee @entity21 . @entity18 was initially booked for simulation and took his protests too far by grabbing the official , which led to his instant dismissal . with 10 men , @entity1 was never able to exert any real pressure on @entity4 and it took two fine saves @entity31 to deny further goals from @entity33 and @entity34 for the away side . victory for @entity4 booked a return to @entity38 for a last four clash with either @entity40 or @entity41 , who are replaying their quarterfinal tie next monday . @entity44 or @entity45 will play @entity46 in the other semifinal . @entity4 had taken a 25th minute lead through @entity49 , the @entity50 defender converting after fine move which involved @entity52 and @entity53 . but the advantage was short lived with @entity18 finding @entity55 to score with a diving header . @entity1 looked to press ahead for the winner , but home hopes were dashed when @entity14 made a hash of a back pass and @entity0 was quick to latch on to the loose ball and beat @entity31 . ' i believe it was justice for him to score he worked extremely hard today , ' @entity4 manager @entity62 said of @entity0 . his counterpart @entity12 will now , barring a miracle , be left without a trophy in his first season in charge of the @entity71 powerhouses , with the pressure now on to seal a top four place in the @entity74 to guarantee @entity76 football next season .
