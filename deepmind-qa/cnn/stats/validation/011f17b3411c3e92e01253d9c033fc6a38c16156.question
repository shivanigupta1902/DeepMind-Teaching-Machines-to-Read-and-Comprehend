( @entity2 ) @entity1 crews on thursday started assessing the damage caused by storms that slashed across @entity5 on wednesday , killing one person and injuring about two dozen others across the state . a reported tornado ravaged a mobile home park , destroying dozens of trailers just west of @entity12 in the suburb of @entity14 . authorities said the man who died at the @entity17 had been trying to help his father , who was injured , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity19 . one woman at the mobile home park told @entity19 that she was cooking when the storm hit . " within 5 minutes it was dark and the sirens were going off and you could n't hear yourself think , " @entity23 said . " and you just grab the kids and we ran across the street . my best friend has the only house that 's back there , and we barely got into the house and it took the garage . it was so fast . " " it looks like there 's been a little war zone around here , " @entity38 told @entity2 affiliate ktul . the storm flattened a @entity14 gymnastics studio , where 60 kids and adults were huddled underground . " we were just in the middle of practice and the sirens started going off and we just had to get all the kids to the basement , " according instructor @entity53 , who said she heard a " big boom " when the building was hit . " just really happy everyone got out safe , " said @entity53 . " it was really scary ... it just seems so surreal . " in addition to the death at the mobile home park , @entity39 reported two other people were taken to the hospital in critical condition . the @entity64 said two dozen people were injured across the state , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity67 . storm damage was reported across the @entity12 metro area . gov. @entity70 toured the damage in @entity14 on thursday and declared a state of emergency for 25 counties . " our hearts and prayers go out to the family that lost a loved one and certainly to those who were injured or lost their home or business , " she said . @entity84 weather also tore through the @entity86 area , including @entity87 , which has seen more than its share of devastating storms . a massive tornado hit @entity87 nearly two years ago , killing 24 people and injuring hundreds of others . the @entity95 said a 2 - mile square area had significant damage , mainly roofs off homes and downed trees . trees had to be cleared so law enforcement and emergency vehicles could get through . " you know , this is n't the first time we 've done this so ... unfortunately , we 've gotten pretty good at getting people back into their residences as quick as we can , " said sgt. @entity103 with the city 's police . until wednesday , there had n't been a single report of a tornado in the @entity115 during march . @entity2 meteorologist @entity116 said there were preliminary reports of seven tornadoes on wednesday . an average year would produce 80 twisters in march , he said . march is typically a transitional month , where warm moist air from the @entity122 collides with cold @entity125 air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes . this year , however , the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the @entity131 had remained stuck in more of a winter mode . but that changed this week as an @entity125 cold front began crashing to the south , bringing together the stormy mix. @entity2 's @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .
