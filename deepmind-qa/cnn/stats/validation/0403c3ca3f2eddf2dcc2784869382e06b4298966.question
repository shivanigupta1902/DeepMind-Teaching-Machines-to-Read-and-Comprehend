( @entity2 ) @entity1 and @entity3 did n't just blur the lines , they crossed them , a @entity6 jury ruled this week . their song " @entity9 " ripped off the @entity11 soul classic " @entity16 , " jurors found , ordering the performers to pay millions for copyright damages and infringement . it 's not the first time singers have turned to the courts to settle an accusation of musical theft . talk about getting blasted : @entity1 and @entity3 were ordered to pay $ 7.4 million . their song : @entity11 's : @entity24 stands his ground : young @entity28 pop sensation @entity27 's 2014 tune " @entity29 " has a riff in the chorus similar to that of the 1989 @entity24 hit " @entity33 . " reports say the two settled out of court , and the official credits now list @entity24 as a co-writer of the @entity27 song . @entity24 says there are no hard feelings . @entity27 's song : @entity24 's : who ya gon na call ? my lawyer ! the 1980s rocker @entity47 accused @entity48 of copying a " @entity50 " song riff from the 1984 hit " @entity51 " by his band , @entity52 . reports at the time said they settled and signed a confidentiality agreement . in 2001 , @entity48 accused @entity47 of breaking it in a televised interview . the movie theme song : @entity52 : ca n't you hear , ca n't you hear the flute riff ? @entity62 band @entity61 lost a case that all but accused them of stealing from children . a court found that the flute solo in their global hit " @entity69 " had plagiarized the children 's tune " @entity75 , " written for the @entity73 organization the @entity74 . ( it was the publisher of the song , @entity78 , that sued . @entity79 , who wrote " @entity75 " in 1934 , died in 1988 . ) @entity61 : the children 's song : yes , there 's a problem . @entity85 hit it big for the first and only time with " @entity88 " in 1990 , rapping over a catchy bass riff that sounded suspiciously like the one in the @entity90 and @entity91 hit " under pressure . " reports at the time said a lawsuit was settled out of court . vanilla ice : @entity90 and @entity91 's tune : not free to do whatever you want . some fans of the @entity102 spoof band the @entity99 noticed what they thought were similarities between the @entity105 hit " whatever " and the @entity109 tune " @entity107 . " headlines suggested that @entity109 was going to sue @entity105 , but in a 2013 interview , the songwriter said it was the music publisher @entity110 who took action and settled out of court , giving a quarter of the monies from " whatever " to @entity109 and a quarter to @entity110 . @entity109 later winked at the incident in the opening notes of the song " @entity121 . " @entity105 : @entity109 , 14 years earlier : if everybody had their own tune : there 's some controversy about how the @entity128 ' first big hit , " @entity129 , " came to be written since the melody seems to be lifted straight from the @entity132 single " @entity131 . " it 's listed now as having been written by the @entity128 ' @entity134 and @entity132 . on his website , @entity132 calls " @entity129 " a cover of his tune . @entity128 : @entity132 : not so fine : one of the most famous copyright disputes in music history targeted former @entity102 @entity141 's song " @entity142 , " which was found to have copied " he 's @entity144 " by the girl group the @entity146 . @entity141 was ordered to pay nearly $ 2 million and was quoted as saying he never made any money off the song -- but he struck back with " @entity149 , " a hit about the incident . it included the line : " as far as i know , it do n't infringe on anyone 's copyright . " the song that got @entity141 sued : the @entity146 : and @entity141 's song about the dispute : @entity2 's @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .
