( @entity1 ) a video appears online . in it , fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful , racist song about lynching african - americans . the video goes viral . you 're president of the university . imagine being in that situation . what would you do ? there are two ways to answer the question . the first is in the moment of crisis . the second is about the long term . as most everyone knows by now , @entity20 , president of the @entity21 , faced just this situation monday . and i 've been thinking about it intensely , not only because i care about race and civic leadership in @entity28 , but also because @entity20 was my first boss , when he was a @entity28 senator . i 'm not from @entity29 but ended up working for @entity20 through a college internship . he was a mentor to me during my years in @entity32 , and a model for me when he left the @entity34 to be of greater use and service as an educator . though we have n't talked since the crisis broke , i see familiar patterns of leadership . @entity20 responded to the crisis swiftly , with a statement that went viral . @entity20 told the students from @entity45 ( @entity45 ) he had a message for them : " you are disgraceful . you have violated all that we stand for . you should not have the privilege of calling yourselves @entity50 " ( the @entity21 nickname ) . @entity20 went on to sever all ties between @entity21 and @entity45 . the national fraternity closed the local chapter . later , @entity20 said he 'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because " we do n't provide student services for bigots . " the next day he expelled two of them . his actions have resonated across the country . on social media , people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by @entity20 's response . why ? because he did something rare in public life today . he expressed a decisive , judgmental view with moral clarity . then he followed through . his statements have been free of mushy lawyer - talk or euphemism . he 's led authentically , from the heart . of course , people have carped . some question whether @entity20 has the legal authority , as head of a public institution , to expel students on the basis of their free speech , even racist hate speech . some lament that what he should have branded as disgraceful was the students ' actions , not the students themselves . legitimate concerns , perhaps . the @entity94 question , certainly , is being debated by legal scholars . but these concerns are eclipsed by the bigger picture . @entity20 was n't just condemning wrongdoers ; he was shifting social norms for all . a cynic might consider laughable a refrain from @entity20 's statement about " real @entity50 . " @entity20 said that real @entity50 are not racists or bigots ; they believe in equal opportunity , treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family . a cynic might say @entity29 is a state both very white and very red , not known for flying the banner of anti-racism . indeed , the original @entity50 were the white settlers who raced in to claim land that had been wrested from @entity116 . but the point of @entity20 's " real @entity50 " riff is not to describe or sanitize today 's reality ; it is to issue a challenge . it is to bind people to a creed , a standard of being and belief that is easy to assert but hard to achieve . not unlike being a true patriot . so now begins the longer term . here , another opportunity arises to lead by example . @entity20 can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen . he can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism . he can now ask his community to face the inequities of history and race . we can all do that . @entity150 , ceo of @entity151 , is doing this at his company . he was moved after the incidents of @entity155 and @entity156 to hold truly open forums with employees about the pain and anguish of racial division . but you do n't have to be a college president or a ceo . you do n't have to be a white man in charge to start a tough reckoning with racism ( though it 'd help if more did ) . whoever you are , you can start a new kind of conversation in your neighborhood . on your campus . at your house of worship . ask what the history is . ask why there are such imbalances of power and voice . ask what it would take to be truly inclusive . then , in word and deed , start answering your own questions . we can all do that . the sooner , the better .
