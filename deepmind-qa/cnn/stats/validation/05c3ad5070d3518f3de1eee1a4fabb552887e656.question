( @entity0 ) the aircraft carrier @entity2 , which saw action in the @entity4 and @entity5 and had appearances in the movies " @entity8 " and " @entity9 , " is on its final journey , a five - month cruise at the end of a tow cable from @entity14 , @entity15 , to a scrapyard in @entity17 . the 56,300 - ton warship , which was launched in 1956 , was decommissioned in 1993 but kept in storage for possible reactivation until march 2004 when it was stricken from the @entity21 and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it and turn it into a museum . but attempts by groups in @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 , @entity32 , to do so came up short of meeting @entity34 government requirements for donation . the @entity29 group called itself @entity36 in reference to the @entity2 's role in the 1986 @entity40 movie . the carrier was used for interior shots in the film , which also featured appearances by the carriers @entity46 and @entity47 , according to @entity48 . in december , the @entity49 paid @entity50 of @entity51 , @entity17 , a penny to take the carrier off its hands . the shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap . the @entity2 , which left @entity14 on thursday , follows two of its predecessors in the @entity62 class of carriers -- the @entity62 and the @entity64 -- to scrapyards in @entity51 . another carrier , the @entity67 , part of the @entity70 class , was towed to @entity51 last year . like the @entity2 , the @entity71 was stored in @entity15 and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of @entity75 , as it would not fit through the @entity76 . the ranger 's final journey is expected to take four to five months , the @entity49 said .

@entity2 , which was launched in 1956 , appeared in movies such as " @entity8 " and " @placeholder "
