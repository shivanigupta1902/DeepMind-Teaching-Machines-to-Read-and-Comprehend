( @entity10 ) notwithstanding the polls , the valiant efforts of the @entity6 @entity5 , a new unity on the @entity3 left and a controversial term , @entity3 prime minister @entity2 's @entity1 party appears to have swept to victory in tuesday 's @entity3 elections . for many in @entity3 , the election turned on domestic economic issues and on personality . pollsters had believed that the combination of rising prices , slowing growth and a controversial leader at the helm of the incumbent @entity1 would finally doom the man who was looking to notch a historic fourth term as premier on his belt . not so much . while it will likely take some time for @entity2 to form a new government , the reverberations of his victory will be felt fast in @entity33 . @entity34 president @entity6 has made no secret of his antipathy toward @entity2 , and many believe that @entity6 has allowed disagreements over policy to spill over into personal animosity . and while the @entity5 allowed it would work with whoever won the @entity3 elections , it seems clear whom the president would have voted for had he been allowed to cast a ballot . so what will @entity6 do on the issues that have increasingly divided @entity3 and the @entity34 ? some believe the president will be all the more constrained in his negotiations with @entity50 , especially now that @entity3 has doubled down on the man who took to a joint meeting of @entity53 to publicly excoriate @entity6 's hoped - for deal with the @entity55 over its nuclear weapons program . but the stronger likelihood is that the @entity1 victory will spur the administration to even more concessions to ensure a deal between @entity62 and @entity33 . this is , after all , an administration that has written off the concerns of all of @entity50 's neighbors ( and @entity34 's allies in the region ) over a weak agreement that would likely do little more than pave the way toward a nuclear weapons capability for the ayatollahs . the reality is that where @entity6 might have been inclined to listen to the @entity3 left ( which differed little with the @entity1 over @entity50 ) , he will find it easy to dismiss the clamoring of the @entity3 right , never mind that it represents the will of the people of @entity3 . then there are the negotiations with the @entity85 . @entity6 has never appeared personally interested in the peace process , though his administration has made repeated attempts to bring both sides to the table . but now @entity33 will be in an even tougher place . @entity85 leader @entity92 has all but abandoned the notion of bilateral negotiations toward @entity85 statehood , and has brought his case instead to the international community . he has promised he will continue to pursue recognition country by country , and through the @entity101 , while at the same time seeking to prosecute @entity3 for " war crimes " through the @entity103 . in the waning days of the election , @entity2 made @entity92 ' job all the easier by reversing his earlier commitment to a @entity85 state , suggesting there would never be one on his watch . the @entity85 returned the favor , announcing that they would redouble their efforts at the @entity103 . this all puts @entity6 in a sticky spot . it will be tempting to just let the @entity85 have at @entity2 , and the president will likely want to do just that . but what about the broader implications of allowing the @entity103 to proceed with accusations by a nonstate actor against a nonmember of the court , all the while insisting it has jurisdiction ? few have any doubt that if unleashed to prosecute whom it wishes by parties without legal standing ( because " @entity136 " is not , in fact , a state ) , @entity103 prosecutions of @entity34 officials will not be far behind . until last week , @entity6 administration policy was to try to walk back the entire @entity103 mess . it is in the best interests of the @entity34 to continue that fight , but best interests are not always the prime mover behind @entity6 administration policies . of course , all involved in this could also act like adults with real issues at stake -- @entity2 and @entity6 could do the right things and put behind them the fuss over the speech to @entity53 , the personal backbiting , and the public bickering . but that would require a maturity that neither party appears to embrace , more the shame for all of us .

@entity165 : @entity166 may spur @entity34 to more concessions in @placeholder talks
