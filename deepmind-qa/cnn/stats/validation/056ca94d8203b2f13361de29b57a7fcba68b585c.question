( @entity1 ) update : @entity2 said in an phone interview monday that his interview with @entity5 was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the @entity7 last week . " she was n't upset , " he told @entity1 . " when you watch the entire interview in the full context , you can see she instigates a lot of the ridiculousness that ensues in the interview . " @entity5 ended the interview laughing , @entity2 said , and " she was in on the joke . " this article has been updated and includes the unedited interview . if you 're going to interview @entity5 , please have some good questions prepared . @entity5 was talking to @entity2 of the @entity24 tv show " @entity23 " in conjunction with " @entity26 , " but @entity2 's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes . @entity2 thought he 'd begin the interview on a casual note , saying @entity5 would be a good person to have a beer with . @entity5 was having none of it . " this date is not going well ; i do not drink beer , " she responded . after some more back - and - forth , with an apparently sometimes testy , sometimes punchy @entity5 trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film , @entity2 finally tried another angle . " how were you able to get that cat to do what you wanted ( it ) to do on a leash ? " he asked about a cat @entity5 's nasty stepmother has in the film . " i tried to put my girlfriend 's cat on a leash , and it just never works for me . " that was enough for @entity5 . " that 's your question ? that 's your f * * * ing question ? " she asked . she stood up and awkwardly presented her hand . the interview was over . @entity2 took it well . he later posted that it was " the best worst interview i 've ever done . " @entity2 later tweeted the unedited interview after an edited version went viral .
