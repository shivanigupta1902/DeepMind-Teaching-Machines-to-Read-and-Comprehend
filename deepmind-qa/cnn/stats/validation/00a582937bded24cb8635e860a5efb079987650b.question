( @entity5 ) the family of @entity1 , an associate of @entity2 who was killed during an @entity4 interrogation , plans to sue the agency . @entity1 's parents filed a " notice of claim " monday , saying they plan to seek $ 30 million in a wrongful death lawsuit . the claim argues the @entity4 has given " no viable justification " to account for shooting and killing @entity1 during a 2013 interrogation in @entity1 's apartment in @entity15 , @entity16 . the interrogation occurred about a month after the @entity19 bombings and centered around another crime linked to bombing suspect @entity2 : a 2011 triple homicide in @entity22 , @entity23 . @entity1 admitted to his direct role in slashing three people 's throats in @entity22 and said @entity2 was involved as well , a federal law enforcement official told @entity5 in 2013 . it was during that interview that @entity1 was shot dead . the @entity30 @entity16 filed the notice of the @entity1 family 's intention to sue on monday . " we are seeking answers and justice for someone who was shot seven times by an @entity4 agent in his own home after hours of interrogation , " said @entity34 , a spokesman for the civil rights group . many things that happened that day do n't add up , @entity34 said . " @entity46 was unarmed with any gun , knife , explosive or other deadly weapon , " the notice says . " @entity46 did not pose a threat of serious bodily harm . " the @entity4 did not immediately respond to a request for comment . officials who spoke to @entity5 after the shooting painted a different picture of what happened during the interrogation . one law enforcement official said @entity1 attacked the @entity4 agent with a broom handle , gashing his head before the agent opened fire . at the time , the official stressed that the shooting was justified and done in self - defense because the agent felt threatened . a @entity68 government official briefed on the investigation rebuffed the idea that @entity46 was n't a threat -- noting , for instance , that he could have taken the agent 's gun . " he was armed . maybe it was n't a weapon , but he had a long object , " the official said . and because of @entity46 's martial arts expertise , " he was a weapon himself . " but from the outset , that argument did n't add up to the @entity46 family . " my son was definitely unarmed , because he never had a gun , " father @entity87 told @entity5 in 2013 . " he could n't attack them or fight them ; he could n't do anything because even two men could easily handle him . " the elder @entity1 suggested his son may have been provoked . " if you question someone for eight hours , you can provoke him into anything , " he said . last year , @entity16 state attorney @entity96 said after an investigation the @entity4 agent 's actions were justified . " ( @entity46 ) went down , but he was not incapacitated . he came up again in an aggressive manner , and the officer then fired the second volley of three or four shots . which at that point essentially incapacitated mr. @entity1 , " @entity96 said . " it would seem almost superhuman , but everything that we have learned in the investigation would show an individual who has a great deal of tolerance of pain and would more or less fight beyond it . " it seemed to me that if the goal was to get away , he could have gone out that back door and gotten away instead of going towards the officers . " @entity5 's @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 contributed to this report .
