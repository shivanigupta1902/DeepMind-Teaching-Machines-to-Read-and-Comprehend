( @entity0 ) oh , @entity1 , why are you so awesome ? the @entity4 - winning actor seems to be just the greatest guy . @entity8 ( as he calls himself on his @entity7 account ) is awesomely winning this game called life by being the most normal of dudes ( well , as normal as you can be as a superstar ) . @entity15 's @entity14 reported that the actor , a @entity17 native , recently stopped by @entity18 in downtown @entity14 , where he bought four boxes of girl scout cookies and donated an additional $ 20 to the troop . he also hung around for a bit , taking pictures with fans who recognized him and bought cookies . just the nicest , right ? here are a few other times @entity1 was the coolest : he danced with the weather lady @entity1 showed what a good sport he was and got his groove on in 2011 when he appeared on @entity32 . the actor joined anchor @entity34 while she did the weather and showed off his smooth moves . he goes the extra mile for fans the superstar won even more hearts when he surprised fan @entity41 backstage after his performance on @entity43 in " @entity44 . " @entity41 , who has autism , was clearly delighted . we really , really like this : @entity1 sings @entity48 he helped us deal with our grief the actor adored his " @entity52 " co-star @entity51 . after @entity51 died in 2012 following a heart attack , @entity1 had those attending his memorial service in stitches with one of his favorite stories about @entity51 . it was a lovely eulogy for his friend . he loves the @entity61 @entity1 and his wife , @entity62 , have one of the most loving and enduring marriages among @entity66 a-listers . the pair wed in 1988 , and fans were thrilled when the couple was caught on @entity61 in 2012 during a @entity71 hockey game . the pair may have been even more excited than the crowd . he documents lost gloves we are n't even sure why he does it , but @entity1 likes to post on social media when he spots lost gloves and mittens . it 's goofy and endearing . he loses stuff , just like us @entity1 took to @entity7 on friday to thank a @entity82 who returned his lost credit card . now he can buy more girl scout cookies !
