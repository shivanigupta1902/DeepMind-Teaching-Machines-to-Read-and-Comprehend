( @entity0 ) when @entity3 photographer @entity2 first pressed the shutter on a borrowed @entity6 camera in 1967 , he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during chairman @entity10 's @entity9 . " i made rolls of film out of a motion - picture reel i found . the photographic paper was left over from printing @entity10 's portraits , " @entity2 told @entity0 . five decades later , @entity2 , 61 , is one of the country 's top photojournalists . his work is a rich chronicle of @entity3 's fast - changing society . " still images are fragments , sections and points that connect the history , " @entity2 says . " the whole process of @entity3 's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- i 've been determined to and have managed to document it all . " one of his most famous series of photographs tracks @entity3 's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family 's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets . photography was an outlet for @entity2 during the dark days of the @entity9 , when @entity3 was convulsed by violent class struggle . his family were labeled " capitalist roaders " and unlike most other kids , he could n't join the red guards . despondent , 14 - year - old @entity2 wandered around @entity44 with friends in similar situations , snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself . taking photos turned into more than a pastime in january 1976 , when premier @entity51 died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of @entity10 's excesses . @entity2 went to @entity56 with his camera , capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief , both then , and again in april that year . " i was in deep grief , " @entity2 said , " and i felt i should record the collective grief . " he kept the film secret from the military , which then employed him as a photographer , transferring it to friends . the photos were published in the early 1980s . from then on , @entity2 saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper . " i did n't get photojournalism until then , " he said . " my biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the @entity9 period ; it would 've been a precious record . " in the decades following , @entity2 has photographed not only major events -- from @entity73 in 1976 and the overthrow of the @entity75 , to the @entity76 in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in @entity3 's changing countryside and growing cities . from april 3 , @entity2 will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the @entity82 at the @entity83 . curator @entity84 -- a @entity3 media scholar and former colleague of @entity2 -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary @entity3 . " it reflects not only the many changes in @entity3 society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition , and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change , " she said . the clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit â€” an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and " the couple 's @entity106 wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom , " she says . @entity2 has spent most of his career at the @entity110 , the country 's official english - language paper , which he joined in 1980 before its official launch . back then , it broke the mold , using large photographs rather than the stamp - sized images used in most other @entity3 newspapers at the time , he says . it was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages , rather than national leaders -- something @entity2 found he excelled at . " thanks to the @entity110 , i stood out . it was an irreplaceable platform . " @entity2 finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s , when ideas emerged and collided after the @entity9 ended . " people thought nothing was impossible , " he said . " we reflected on the past and were determined to move on . it was a special time ; the air was filled with ideals , enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities . " today 's @entity3 is different , he said . " the country 's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s , " he said . " individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals . " throughout his career , @entity2 's focus has changed a great deal as well . he said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography , but now , with smart phones , he says anyone can be a photographer . to @entity2 , what matters is the perspective , he said , pointing at his head . @entity2 says he 's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years . " my job is n't to chant slogans . " " i take photos first . it 's great if they can be published ; if not , they 'll eventually be part of the history . " next year will mark @entity2 's 40th year in photojournalism . he is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it " unfinished . " the name was inspired by the alternative title of @entity174 's @entity173 . " @entity3 is unfinished , " said @entity2 , who is also fan and critic of classic music . " it 's always a work in progress . "
