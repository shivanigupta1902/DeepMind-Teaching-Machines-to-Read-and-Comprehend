( @entity1 ) i am a friendly , hard - working @entity3 native . it 's how a lot of my friends in @entity7 describe @entity8 . it 's as if we 're assembled at " @entity11 , " devoid of color or depth . we supposedly represent all that is wholesome in @entity16 . that may be true , but " friendly and hard - working " is so ... bland . if you think i 'm being a tad harsh , ask anyone who is n't from the @entity8 to describe someone born and raised in @entity21 . my favorite definition came from a colleague raised in @entity24 . she struggled to describe us at first , then said , " simple . " um , like the @entity27 ? " no , " she said , flustered . even my fellow @entity8 have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors . @entity1 legal analyst @entity30 is a proud native of @entity31 , @entity32 . first thing out of his mouth , " friendliness ! " after that , he struggled , too . " boy , let me see ... um. . . not easily agitated ? " i rolled my eyes . " that is so bland , @entity30 . " he paused , then said , " i 'll take bland over the rap @entity24 gets any day . " even my new friend , @entity41 , from @entity42 struggled . the best he could come up with was " hearty . " i asked these questions after interviewing @entity45 , who wants his native @entity46 to divorce itself from the @entity8 . " we 're @entity8 if you 're looking at it from @entity7 or from anywhere on [ the @entity54 ] @entity53 , " @entity45 told me . " but then again , that 's someone else 's definition . i think it 's time for us to claim our own . " @entity45 and his brother , @entity58 , whose father is the state 's governor , are @entity62 businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor . @entity45 , after touring @entity67 ( many @entity66 are of @entity69 descent ) , became enthralled by the region 's strong identity . it proudly embraced its chilly weather , its food , its culture , its ... @entity76 . so why , he questioned , did n't @entity46 ? when @entity45 got home he hired a @entity46 company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said , " @entity31 . " they sold out and @entity45 's idea headed , well , north . @entity66 just got it , he said . i admit , i did n't get it , until i thought more about it . @entity46 -- or should i say @entity62 -- is criticized , by some of my compatriots , for being " @entity46 nice , " the sort of " nice " ( fake ) that is n't remotely the kind of " nice " ( sincere ) for which @entity8 are renowned . but , hey , i have an open mind . you could argue that @entity46 , along with @entity98 , parts of @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity42 and @entity32 , are in the @entity99 of the @entity16 . and , you could argue @entity3 , @entity100 and @entity101 are eastern states . the only truly @entity8 states are @entity96 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 . go ahead , argue among yourselves , but know that mr. @entity45 is n't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling @entity46 -- " @entity111 . " he 's talking about image and , although he wo n't say it , branding . " the @entity115 had done an article highlighting different @entity118 side dishes , " @entity45 told me . " for @entity46 , they named grape salad as our signature side dish . and no one in @entity46 had ever heard of grape salad ... it was kind of a harmless example , but if we do n't tell the rest of the country who we are , we end up with grape salad . " that story got under my skin , especially when i looked up the @entity115 idea of @entity3 's signature side dish : @entity137 pea and onion salad . it gets worse . the @entity115 extolled the salad 's " deliciousness " by saying it " calls to mind the processed - food delights that , for decades , characterized the cooking of the @entity8 . " seriously ? the @entity115 is n't solely to blame for the @entity8 's image problem . politicians are , too . @entity146 is a distinguished professor of history at @entity148 in @entity3 . he wrote a book called " the identity of the @entity8 : essays on @entity151 . " " the @entity8 , " he told me , " has always been a dynamic and diverse place , but that image does n't fit with what people want to believe . " and , by people , @entity146 means politicians who routinely use the @entity8 as code for a place in time that never actually existed : crime - free and populated with hard - working people who all look and worship the same . " arguing about the @entity8 , " @entity146 says , " has become arguing about @entity16 as a whole . " so , listen up , campaigning politicians ! stop trying to bond with the @entity8 with your bowling prowess ( or lack thereof ) and for goodness ' sake , stop eating corn dogs at state fairs . and while i 'm at it , political reporters , please stop interviewing voters in diners ! i 'm not maligning bowling ( my dad , @entity177 , is in the @entity178 ) or corn dogs , but those things do n't represent the modern @entity8 . it is so much more dynamic and , yes , diverse . @entity182 is not like @entity183 . @entity184 is not like @entity185 . @entity186 is not like @entity187 , or @entity188 or @entity189 or @entity190 . and , @entity62 is not like any of them , either . @entity46 boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold - weather sports , such as pond hockey . yet , i 'm from @entity197 , @entity3 , and i have never touched a hockey stick ( although those other " northern " states certainly have excellent puck - handling abilities ) . @entity62 also has a thriving cultural community , is home to 19 @entity205 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods . and , at the moment -- it has what many polite @entity8 ca n't abide by -- attitude . you know , @entity46 nice . definition ? as my pal from @entity42 puts it , " sarcastic , pretentious and exclusionary . " " i know . arrogant @entity46 , " @entity45 joked . " that 's what everyone thinks of when they think of @entity46 . right ? no , again , this is n't about being better . it 's not a relative thing . it 's just i think there are a lot of great things happening in @entity46 . it 's not being recognized . i think it 's important for the reasons we 've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer . and so it 's just putting forth our story . it 's not trying to make it look better than it is . it 's not comparing ourselves to anyone else . " i do n't know if @entity188 will be successful , but i do understand why he wants @entity46 to define @entity46 . you do n't attract the best and the brightest with " friendly . " " there is a competition for talent , " @entity45 said . " and it 's a national competition , even an international competition . " maybe @entity3 should join the rebranding club and become " @entity247 . " ' cause you know what ? i may be friendly and hard - working , but i 'm not simple . so stop asking me if i 've ever gone " cow tipping . " or i just might go all @entity46 on you .

@entity253 : the @placeholder is not ' flyover country ' and has more to offer than friendliness .
