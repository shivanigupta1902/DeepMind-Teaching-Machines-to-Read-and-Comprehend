( @entity1 ) @entity0 and skipper @entity2 significantly boosted its own chances and delivered a probable knockout blow to @entity6 's hopes of @entity8 qualification with 3 - 0 home win sunday . first half goals from @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity2 effectively ended the @entity14 match as a contest , with the win leaving @entity0 in fourth spot , but only two points adrift of second - placed @entity19 . @entity6 is seventh , six points adrift of the top four . @entity2 's third after another piece of disastrous defending from the visitors led to an impromptu and topical goal celebration , which was certainly the main talking point . a national newspaper had posted a video on on social media sunday which appeared to show @entity2 being felled by fellow @entity14 footballer and former @entity0 teammate @entity31 as both donned boxing gloves for a " friendly " fight in his kitchen . after he had converted following a mistake by @entity38 , @entity2 threw a few mock punches then keeled over backwards on to the @entity41 turf . @entity6 's players and fans were probably the only people not to see the funny side , but the joke was on them , having gone into the match seeking a third straight away win at @entity0 and five games unbeaten against the @entity50 . from @entity0 first significant attack on nine minutes , an unmarked @entity11 was found by @entity12 and the @entity53 international beat @entity54 with a low shot . @entity11 caused chaos in the @entity6 defense for the second with @entity12 left free to head home from distance . @entity2 's emphatic strike after @entity38 gifted him possession , proved the icing on the cake . the victory eases the pressure on manager @entity67 and his expensively assembled side after some lackluster recent performances and last monday 's disappointing @entity71 exit to @entity72 . it meant @entity6 , off the back of two straight wins and with @entity76 in top form , was favored going into the crucial match , but the young striker barely had a glimpse of goal , until having his side 's first shot on target after fully 88 minutes as @entity0 dominated . earlier , @entity85 extended its lead at the top of the @entity14 to six points but was held 1 - 1 at home to @entity90 in another less than convincing performance from @entity93 's team . off the back of a disappointing @entity8 exit to @entity96 , @entity85 again struggled to find its best form at @entity98 despite going in front from @entity101 's 18th league goal . @entity102 equalized from the spot for the @entity90 after @entity104 was adjudged to have fouled @entity105 , with @entity85 protests waved away . @entity85 found @entity107 hard to beat and the visiting goalkeeper made fine saves from @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 to deny the leaders three points . however , it has a commanding lead plus a game in hand over chasing @entity19 , which lost 1 - 0 to @entity118 saturday , in a severe blow to hopes of retaining the title . in sunday 's other @entity14 clash , @entity122 eased its relegation fears with a 3 - 0 win over @entity126 , who had @entity128 sent off for a foul on @entity130 , who is on loan at @entity132 from @entity6 . in @entity134 , @entity133 snapped a recent lean spell of scoring form with both goals as @entity138 beat @entity139 2 - 0 in the @entity140 . the record signing struck first in the 17th minute when @entity143 's acrobatic effort was cleared off the line and the @entity145 scored the rebound . the same combination was at work for the second in the 40th minute with @entity143 's strike helped into the visiting net by @entity133 . @entity143 might have added to the tally and missed several opportunities but @entity138 was never threatened by @entity139 and eased to the three points . it leaves them a point adrift of @entity157 ahead of next weekend 's @entity158 , which could go a long way to determining the title race .
