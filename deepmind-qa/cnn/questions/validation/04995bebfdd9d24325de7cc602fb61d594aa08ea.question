( @entity0 ) hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across @entity3 this weekend , incensed by serious economic woes and a massive scandal involving the country 's oil company . the demonstrators have called for president @entity9 to be impeached . @entity0 correspondent @entity10 , who lives in @entity11 , explains who the demonstrators are , why they 're mad and what could be in store for the president and the country . what do the protesters want ? they 're angry about the country 's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged . if it were just one of those things , maybe we would n't be seeing this kind of turnout because @entity3 have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in october . but it 's all come to a head . political corruption -- let 's break that down . what 's the scandal about ? @entity43 is the national oil company . it 's one of the most powerful , richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world . it was very respected . people invested in it . @entity9 , who won election in october by a slim margin , was -- before becoming president -- the chairwoman of @entity43 ' board of directors . she was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to @entity59 executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from @entity43 . in early march , the country 's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians , many of them from the president 's ruling @entity67 and the speakers of the @entity71 and @entity72 . but @entity9 has n't been accused of anything , right ? right . she 's not being investigated . protesters ' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing , because she 's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely . but , the public perception is that even if she did n't personally profit for this scheme , she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable . has she responded to the protesters ? she has . what she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she 's rooting it out . as proof , she contends , she 's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company . it 's important to know that the @entity43 scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during @entity9 's election campaign , she said over and over that she would root out corruption . it 's also interesting that she is n't lashing out at protesters . she is saying she wo n't put up with violence -- and so far the protests have n't gotten violent . but she says that @entity3 is a democratic country and people have the right to protest . she comes from a left - wing background so that approach is fitting . you brought up that she is from the left - wing @entity67 . how is that significant ? the protests were mostly organized by the right - wing party that opposes @entity9 ... organized by people who did n't vote for her . there are n't people out today protesting . the next demonstrations are scheduled for april 12 . i guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that . yes , well , that 's @entity3 . it 's so the word can get out on social media . if she 's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated , will the protests affect her presidency ? @entity9 has four years ahead of her , it could end up being very hard for her govern . she won a little over half the vote in october and the people who did n't vote for her are still making their voices heard . and this @entity43 scandal is a problem . why was the election so close ? you have to bring it back to the economy . it had been slowing down , and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like @entity11 have n't voted for @entity9 's party , the @entity67 . the country is at 7.5 % inflation . the april 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road , what might happen ? the @entity72 and @entity71 speakers are @entity9 's allies and they are among those implicated in the @entity43 scheme . what if she is n't able to get badly needed legislation ? what will she do ? what will be party do ? these questions are hard to answer now . @entity0 's @entity155 in @entity156 talked with @entity0 's @entity157 who lives and reports in @entity3 .
