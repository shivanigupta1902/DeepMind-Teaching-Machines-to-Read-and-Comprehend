( @entity1 ) @entity0 or @entity2 ? if you 're a fan of the hit tv show " @entity5 , " you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series . if you are n't a fan , you may soon be in the minority . the show has become something of an industry phenomenon , with ratings growing every week . according to @entity17 , two weeks before the season finale , which is set to air on march 18 , ratings were up 53 % from its january 7 premiere in the coveted 18 - 49 demo and total viewership had risen 45 % , from 9.9 million to 14.3 million . eight straight weeks of growth is almost unheard - of these days in broadcast tv , which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services . but @entity28 's " @entity5 " is doing the damn thing . the show revolves around the character of record label owner @entity31 ( played by @entity32 ) and his family , which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what 's hers . " you 're so beautiful , " @entity5 , and here are some of the reasons why : @entity46 @entity46 has been in the industry for a minute , and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like " @entity53 " and " @entity54 " ( the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress @entity56 nomination ) , her career had n't really taken off . not so now . @entity46 has sunk her teeth into the role of @entity61 family matriarch cookie . the character is hard - core and street smart and loves her family fiercely , even as she is also motivated by making money . the show 's co-creator , @entity66 , told @entity68 that fans can thank @entity46 for the now infamous " @entity2 " nickname that viewers have come to love . when @entity60 sneeringly calls her ex-husband @entity31 ' new lady love , @entity75 ( played by @entity76 ) , " @entity2 , " you want to yell at the screen , " get her , cookie ! " " so , basically @entity46 is a genius , " @entity66 said . " she 's a comic genius , but she 's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress , and we 're utilizing all that in @entity0 . " watch for @entity46 to snag nominations next award season . it 's old school soapy think " dynasty " and " @entity88 " for the 21st century . it has all the things that make prime - time soaps so delicious : sex , scores to settle , family tensions , violence and did we mention sex ? set in the world of the music industry , there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy , dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode . that 's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that " and then what ? " itch . it 's new - school hip " @entity5 " has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern . one of the primary story lines has been about homophobia , as @entity31 and his son @entity120 ( @entity122 ) battle over @entity120 revealing he 's gay . it comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights . series co-creator @entity130 , himself an openly gay man , has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community . " homophobia is rampant in the @entity137 - @entity136 community , and men are on the @entity139 ( down low , meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women ) . they do n't come out , because your priest says , your pastor says , mama says , your next - door neighbor says , your homie says , your brother says , your boss says ( that homosexuality is wrong ) , " @entity149 reported @entity130 saying during the @entity151 press tour in january . " and they are killing @entity137 - @entity136 women . they are killing our women . so i wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community . " the music is off the hook the show has managed to improve on what " glee " did and succeed at what the now - canceled @entity170 drama " smash " tried to do : fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry . @entity122 has been the breakout star in this area . his mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack 's more popular tunes , including the anthem to individuality , " @entity184 , " which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service @entity186 . superproducer @entity187 ( best known for work with artists including @entity190 and @entity191 ) and his protegee @entity192 are responsible for the show 's sound . @entity192 told @entity195 the music has to be authentic and original . " one of the things that @entity199 told me is , ' if it sounds like something you 've heard before , do n't do it , ' " he said . of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on @entity207 . fingers crossed for a possible " @entity5 " tour featuring @entity122 and other co-stars including @entity211 , who portrays youngest @entity31 son @entity212 and who in real life raps under the moniker @entity216 . the awesome guest appearances you could have knocked us over with a feather when @entity221 popped up on the show . @entity221 had a bit role on this first season , as has supermodel @entity225 and ' 80s actor @entity226 . the series has been hyping appearances from music stars like @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 . given the popularity of the show , there 's no telling who will pop up on season 2 . @entity46 and @entity32 the love / hate relationship between @entity60 and @entity240 is everything . they have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite . chalk it up to the longtime friendship between @entity46 and @entity32 , who also co-starred in the film " @entity53 . " @entity32 told @entity250 that he and @entity46 had to do a " chemistry read " to show that they clicked . the end result has been magical . " we have so much fun , " @entity32 said .
