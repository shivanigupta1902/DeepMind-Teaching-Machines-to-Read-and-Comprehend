@entity1 ( @entity2 ) three area residents were arrested and charged wednesday for allegedly operating four @entity4 schools for @entity6 and @entity7 students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a " pay - to - stay " scheme . the three educators collected as much as $ 6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from @entity16 and @entity7 , said federal prosecutors . the arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud , money laundering and other immigration offenses . an allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme , authorities said . @entity33 , 51 , of @entity34 , is the owner and manager and of the postsecondary schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud , authorities said . the two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense : they are @entity45 , also known as @entity46 , 39 , of @entity1 who assisted in the operation and management of the schools ; and @entity50 , also known as @entity51 , 32 , of @entity1 , a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school . @entity33 , who also went by @entity56 and @entity57 , is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence , as well as two counts of money laundering , prosecutors said . the three defendants and their attorneys could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday . " immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules , " acting u.s. attorney @entity65 said in a statement . " in this case , officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country . this type of fraud against the @entity81 will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system , " the federal prosecutor said . three of the schools are in @entity1 ' @entity90 neighborhood : @entity91 / @entity92 ; @entity94 , an @entity95 ( @entity96 ) ; and the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , authorities said . the fourth school is currently operating in @entity99 , @entity4 : @entity100 and @entity101 , authorities said . " what we 've broken up is a pay - to - stay scheme , " said @entity102 , special agent in charge of the @entity1 office of @entity105 . " that 's a scheme where institutions purport to be schools , but are really not doing any education whatsoever , " he said . " any scheme where someone gains access to the @entity81 through fraud is also a national security vulnerability , " @entity102 said . " although we do n't have any information that any of these people wish to do harm to the @entity81 , the point is anyone could take advantage of a vulnerability like this . which is why it is so important that we identify these vulnerabilities and shut them down . " @entity129 was located on the fifth floor of a @entity1 office tower near the @entity90 neighborhood , but @entity134 agents said they found the school " abandoned " during their raid on wednesday . the agents allowed @entity2 to attend the raid . the school featured classrooms , administrative offices and a small library , but no one occupied the spaces . in fact , the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set , filled with props and decorations , but no actors . in one small room , a cd player serenaded empty desks with classical music . the tiny library featured @entity156 and @entity157 pennants . the television was n't even plugged in . one federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older , in their 30s , 40s and 50s . @entity165 's 2011 - 2012 catalog describes the facility as an @entity167 as second language school and states " it is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand @entity167 in all facets of life by providing a top quality @entity177 educational environment , " according to a copy of the document on the website of the @entity182 . " our enthusiastic and qualified instructors concern themselves with teaching a rigorous , but innovative curriculum of interactive and beneficial courses and materials leading to higher toefl scores and admission to @entity81 colleges and universities , " the catalog says . another document with the state bureau indicates @entity165 had a 73 % graduation rate in 2011 and a 60 % rate in 2010 . but the indictment alleges that students actually lived @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 . the schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the @entity81 , authorities said . the document , called a form @entity209 , made a student eligible for a f - 1 student visa . in exchange for that form , students paid $ 1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months , authorities said . during their investigation , authorities interviewed 35 students , mainly from @entity16 , and found none resided in @entity1 , officials said . an unannounced federal inspection of @entity165 's main site in 2011 found only one @entity167 class with three students , though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites , prosecutors said . on the same day , federal authorities also visited the @entity97 found only one religion with one student , though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students , prosecutors said . some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other @entity81 schools also participating in the federal @entity243 , prosecutors said . the conspiracy count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years . the immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison , and the money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years , authorities said . wednesday 's arrests follow last week 's federal raids of more than three dozen " maternity hotels " in @entity4 where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a @entity81 - citizen baby , authorities said . the " maternity tourism " sites included apartment complexes in @entity1 , @entity261 and @entity263 counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said . those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from @entity7 , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by @entity105 . those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said . specifically , authorities in the maternity tourism raids obtained search warrants for 37 location and conducted searches at more than 50 locations , including sites that consented to a federal search , said @entity283 , a spokeswoman for @entity105 .

students largely came from @placeholder and @entity7 , feds say
