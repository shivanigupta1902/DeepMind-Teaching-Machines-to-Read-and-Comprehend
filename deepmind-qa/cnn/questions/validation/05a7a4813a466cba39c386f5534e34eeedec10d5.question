( @entity1 ) @entity0 claimed the first silverware of the @entity4 domestic season and @entity6 's first trophy of his second spell in charge with a 2 - 0 win over @entity10 at @entity11 sunday . deflected efforts either side of halftime from @entity0 captain @entity15 and leading scorer @entity16 dashed @entity10 's hopes in the all - @entity19 final . @entity0 had suffered a chastening @entity21 defeat to the same opposition in the @entity23 , with @entity24 starring , but the promising young @entity4 striker was kept largely quiet in the showpiece occasion . the first half saw @entity10 edge the possession and carry more of the attacking threat , with @entity31 's free kick rattling the @entity0 crossbar . but chances for either side from open play were in short supply and it was from a free kick that @entity0 went ahead just before the break . @entity41 's delivery from the right brushed @entity44 's head and fell invitingly to @entity15 whose shot went into the net after taking a deflection off @entity48 . @entity10 might have felt hard done by and the sense of injustice would have deepened on 56 minutes as @entity51 found @entity16 down the left and his firm strike took another wicked deflection , this time off @entity55 , who was credited with the own goal , to leave goalkeeper @entity58 with no chance . it seemed to take the sting out of the @entity10 challenge and although @entity24 had a late half chance , it was @entity15 who typically snuffed out the threat with a timely tackle . it was the fifth time @entity0 had lifted the @entity69 and third under @entity6 . the @entity70 claimed it in his first season with the west @entity75 club in 2005 and after returning to the @entity77 hot seat last season has broken his mini-trophy drought . @entity6 , whose side is also well - placed to go through to the quarterfinals of the @entity82 , was clearly reveling in his latest success , his 21st career trophy as a manager . " ' it is important to feel like a kid at 52 years old , " he said . man of the match @entity15 is hoping it will pave the way for further triumphs . " it 's the first trophy this season and it 's massive . it meant an awful lot to us when we won it in @entity6 's first year in 2005 as well , " he said . " that could be the start of something very good . we have to kick on and we have got the league to focus on , but it 's a great day and a great win . " @entity103 blow @entity0 was also boosted by an earlier result in the @entity23 as its nearest title rival @entity103 was beaten 2 - 1 at @entity106 . @entity103 had hoped to cut the gap at the top on @entity0 to just two points with a win at @entity111 , but instead suffered a chastening reverse . @entity113 put @entity106 ahead with a thumping shot after just 11 minutes only for @entity115 to draw @entity103 , defending the @entity23 title , level midway through the first half . @entity106 , looking to boost its own chances of @entity82 football next season , dominated after the break and deservedly took three points after @entity125 scored a superb late winner with a curling shot which flew past @entity128 . @entity129 stayed third by beating @entity130 2 - 0 with @entity131 and @entity132 scoring late in each half to give the @entity134 a boost after a @entity82 defeat to @entity137 in midweek .
