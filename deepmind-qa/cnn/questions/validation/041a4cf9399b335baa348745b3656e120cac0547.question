@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity3 brought his @entity5 swagger to @entity1 on saturday , leading a crowd of activists to cheers as he sought to draw a contrast to his top - tier rival in the unofficial @entity12 presidential race , @entity13 . the @entity15 governor , amid charges from critics that he 's a flip - flopper , also acknowledged that he had changed positions on immigration reform but argued that he 's remained consistent in everything else . @entity3 was met with great fanfare at his only open event during his two - day stop to the first - in - the - nation primary state . activists gathered at @entity27 for a training event that was hosted by the @entity1 @entity12 and headlined by @entity3 's appearance . @entity13 makes 2016 debut in @entity1 the contrasts made against @entity13 were subtle , but @entity3 emphasized his modest roots as the son of a preacher and reiterated his penchant for shopping at @entity37 's while armed with coupons . " i actually stopped by @entity37 's and bought this sweater in the rack where it 's 70 % off , " he said , pointing to the sweater he was wearing . " and we paid one dollar for it with our @entity45 ... so , living the high life , " he added . @entity3 has used his humble beginnings and department - store bona fides in @entity49 as well , a strategy aimed to cement the fact that he did n't grow up with " fame and fortune , " as he frequently says . on saturday , he also put on a cap handed to him by an audience member with the logo for @entity57 . " you 've got a first - rate record on the @entity61 ; we hope you 'll wear the hat often and keep up the good work , " the man said . @entity3 wore it for the rest of his time on stage . ( while he may have donned the cap - and - sweater look saturday afternoon , he was set to sport a tux later that night for his speaking appearance at the @entity72 's annual white - tie dinner in @entity74 president @entity73 was also scheduled to speak at the dinner . ) answering a question from another audience member , @entity3 laid down his staunch opposition to @entity79 , a set of testing standards that @entity13 defended as usual during his visit to @entity1 on friday . @entity3 also stood against re-authorizing the @entity83 , another topic on which the two @entity12 disagree . those comments came after @entity3 argued , in an interview with the @entity87 on friday , that @entity13 would represent a step towards the past , rather than the future . " we had @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 . if it 's just whoever 's next up , that has n't worked so well for the @entity12 in the past , " he said . " @entity13 's a good man . you 're not going to hear me speak ill will of @entity13 ... i just think voters are going to look at this and say , ' if we 're running against @entity102 , we 'll need a name from the future -- not a name from the past -- to win . ' " in his remarks saturday , @entity3 also hit the president over foreign policy and took a shot at @entity102 for giving " @entity111 a reset button . " on domestic policy , he laid out his small - government vision for a system in which success is measured by " how many people are no longer dependent on the government . " asked by reporters saturday to respond to flip - flopping accusations by his critics , @entity3 said the " the only major issue out there was immigration . " indeed @entity3 reversed his stance earlier this month when he acknowledged that he 's no longer in favor of legislation that would let undocumented immigrants remain in the @entity129 . he said saturday that his change in tune reflected the will of the public . " this is one where we listened to the people all across the country , particularly border governors who saw how this president messed that up , and that 's an issue where i think people want leaders who are willing to listen to the people on that , " he said . any other accusations of flip - flopping , he added , " are just ridiculous . " critics have argued that @entity3 has been taking a tougher line against abortion in an effort to woo conservatives during the primaries . the governor recently expressed support for a ban on abortion after 20 weeks , after first declining to state his position during his re-election bid in the fall . and critics point to an ad by his campaign in which @entity3 said he supports legislation that leaves " the final decision to a woman and her doctor . " @entity3 said saturday he 's remained steady in his views on abortion . " i 'm pro-life . my position is consistent on that , " he said . " they 're taking an ad out there that talked about what the law did in the state ( that ) was endorsed by @entity178 , so it 's a pro-life law . " he also defended his support for the federal ethanol mandate that helps @entity49 farmers , despite opposing it in @entity15 in the past . @entity3 's more private itinerary included meetings with @entity1 business and political leaders , including @entity189 ' former senator , @entity188 , who resides in @entity1 and ran unsuccessfully for the @entity191 seat in the state last year .
