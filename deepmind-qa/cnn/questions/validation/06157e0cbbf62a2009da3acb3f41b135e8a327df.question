( @entity1 ) @entity0 is going to be extra special this year , as 2015 stretches the symbolic march 14 celebration out a little longer to 3.1415 . and if you mark pi at 9:26.53 in the morning or night , you 're just a little more in line with the celebrated irrational number that never ends . to 31 decimal places , pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795 . a few more tidbits about pi and @entity0 : about pi @entity10 is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter . it 's not equal to the ratio of any two whole numbers , so an approximation -- 22/7 -- is used in many calculations . @entity10 is essential in architecture and construction and was used frequently by early astronomers . @entity10 has been known for about 4,000 years , but it started to be called by the @entity24 letter only in the 1700s . the origin of @entity0 @entity0 started 27 years ago at @entity28 's @entity27 . physicist @entity29 , who worked in the electronics group at the museum , started celebrating pi on march 14 , 1988 , primarily with museum staffers . the tradition has grown to embrace math enthusiasts from all walks of life . celebrations this year , the @entity27 is hosting a day - long celebration at its facility on @entity41 , including a @entity42 , servings of pie and a pizza pie dough - tossing event . @entity0 is also @entity47 's birthday . in @entity50 , @entity51 , where @entity47 lived for more than two decades , signs of the scientist permeate the @entity0 festivities , from birthday parties at the @entity54 of @entity50 to an @entity47 lookalike contest . plus the requisite pie - eating , pie - throwing and pizza pie creation . for more about pi , visit @entity60 . @entity1 's @entity61 contributed to this report .
