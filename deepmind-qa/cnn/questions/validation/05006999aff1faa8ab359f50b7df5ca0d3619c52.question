@entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 hang from the antlers of a pair of moose heads above the bar inside an old music hall . dim red light shines on classic leather booths . you push through a crowd dancing to a live rockabilly band and head to the toilet , tipsy . then something weird happens -- you exit the washroom and find yourself in a different bar . the early 1900s dance hall with chandeliers has vanished . suddenly , you 're in a whimsical bar with a pirate serving drinks . no , you have n't had too much to drink and the washroom is n't a passageway through a time - space continuum . you 've simply stepped into the maritime - themed @entity25 . inside @entity28 's @entity27 , the @entity25 is an example of the latest nightlife trend in @entity2 -- hidden bars . sultry old days " we actually did n't mean to turn the @entity34 into a secret bar , " says @entity32 , general manager of @entity28 's . " we were just lazy and did n't publicize it . " the story behind the hidden bar takes in a bit of sultry local history . before @entity28 's moved in , the building was occupied by the @entity42 , a longtime strip club . @entity43 , owner of local restaurant peasant and @entity45 , took over the place and renovated it , preserving some of the old establishment 's bawdy touches . " we loved the mirror too much to take it down , " says @entity43 , referring to the long mirror that still runs the length of one wall . " it used to be in front of the dance floor for the girls , but we turned the dance floor into booths . " " if you look at the floor , you can still see some of the holes where dancing poles used to be , " says @entity32 . a list of prices for services rendered by different girls still hangs inside the toilet . the bar counter upstairs is where customers once paid for extra services from dancers before entering a small room ( now the @entity25 , which sells beer in cans ) . mermaid bar : secret escape " there are actually three entrances to the @entity25 , " says @entity43 of the hidden bar . " it 's my favorite place . it 's a lot of loud fun out there at @entity28 's sometimes , and the @entity34 is like my escape . " the small mermaid is bright , with light shining through the windows . sharks hang from the ceiling and paintings of mermaids adorn the walls . people love the mermaid for different reasons . " some like the bartender dressed up as a pirate , " says @entity32 . " some say it 's the cannon on the pirate ship model behind the bar . " that pirate bartender , @entity102 , says the apple rum made from fresh - pressed apple juice is the real crowd - pleaser . about those bras on the moose antlers while the mermaid is a rum bar , @entity28 's is a whiskey bar -- each has about 100 varieties of rum or whiskey , and a food menu . three bands usually perform each night at @entity28 's and the bar always gets busy after 9 p.m. so what 's up with the bras on the moose heads ? " i once dared a customer on a hen night to sling a bra to the horn to win a free shot , " says @entity43 . " she did and it has become a tradition ever since . " " we have a strict bra - only policy .

" it really was a storeroom , " says a manager at the @entity142 . " we have been hoping to make use of the space , but it was n't until after the big flood in 2011 that we renovated the place into an underground bar .
