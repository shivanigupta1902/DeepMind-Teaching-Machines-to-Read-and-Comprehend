( @entity0 ) my name is @entity3 , and i am a professor of @entity4 and @entity6 origins in the @entity7 at @entity8 . i was series adviser and one of many on - camera experts on @entity0 's " finding @entity11 , " which airs on sundays . i also appear in each episode of the program . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the " finding jesus " facebook page during the latest episode , " @entity18 . " below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them . they have been edited for style and clarity for this article : @entity24 : what do scholars know about the man named @entity28 ? what is his story ? @entity3 : @entity28 is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the @entity4 . in fact , the relative lack of information about him in the @entity35 has provided the invitation , across the centuries , for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand @entity11 over to the authorities . we know very little about his back story from the @entity35 . he appears in the list of 12 disciples called by @entity11 , but does not become a main character in the drama until the @entity52 . in @entity53 , he is the disciple who is concerned about @entity54 wasting money anointing @entity11 ( @entity53 12.4 - 6 ) . soon afterward , he is arranging to hand @entity11 over to the authorities . his story ends with his dramatic suicide ( @entity59 27.3 - 10 ) , and @entity60 tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died ( acts 1.18 - 19 ) . @entity3 answers your questions about the @entity66 @entity67 : my understanding was always that @entity28 betrayed @entity11 not because he was a villain , but he thought @entity11 would start an earthly war when arrested . he was trying to get @entity11 to establish a literal , physical kingdom on @entity72 . @entity3 : this is one of the great mysteries of the last week of @entity11 ' life . what motivated @entity28 to betray @entity11 ? @entity53 hints that it was financial greed ( @entity53 12.6 ) , and @entity59 says that he betrayed @entity11 for " thirty pieces of silver " ( @entity59 27.14 - 15 ) . it is true , though , that many have speculated that @entity28 may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter , and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction . with this theory , he was trying to force @entity11 ' hand . it has sometimes been said that perhaps the word " @entity28 " is a corruption of the word " sicarii , " which means " dagger bearer , " and that would provide some backing to that theory . however , @entity53 identifies @entity28 as " son of @entity98 " , which makes the " sicarii " theory less likely . in the end , we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about @entity28 ' motivation . @entity106 answers your questions about @entity109 @entity110 : are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate ? are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous ? @entity3 : that 's a good question . well , we probably have as much of the @entity18 as we will ever have . several additional fragments of the @entity120 , in which the @entity18 is featured , came to light after @entity122 , the dealer who owned the codex for some time , went bankrupt . now , it is estimated that we have something like 90 % to 95 % of the text . with regards to translation and interpretation , this process will continue for years to come , as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts . i think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job , all the more so as they were working with an incomplete , damaged and very complex @entity136 text that had been lost for centuries . but i also greatly admire @entity139 's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the @entity18 that this has brought about . i was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the @entity18 dramatized so effectively in " finding @entity11 . " @entity144 : is there a place that we can find and read the @entity18 ? @entity3 : the @entity149 website on the @entity18 does feature the original translation from 2006 . as far as i am aware , there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation . watch the latest episode anytime on @entity157 @entity158 : good question would be did @entity11 know @entity28 would betray him when / before he chose him ? @entity3 : the @entity35 writers themselves single out @entity28 as the one who would betray @entity11 ( more accurately " hand him over " ) as soon as they introduce him ( e.g. @entity162 ) , but they , of course , are writing with the benefit of hindsight . we can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical @entity11 . our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical @entity11 are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction . if you would like to read more about @entity28 , a good starting point is provided in this article on the @entity183 's @entity182 website . it is written by " @entity11 " contributor @entity185 . and if you would like to read more about the @entity18 , " finding @entity11 " contributor @entity139 discusses it on @entity182 . is @entity28 in hell ?
