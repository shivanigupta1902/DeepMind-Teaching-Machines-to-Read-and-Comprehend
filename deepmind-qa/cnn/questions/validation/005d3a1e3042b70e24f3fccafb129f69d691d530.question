( @entity2 ) @entity1 relic experts claim that a 1,000 - year - old mummified monk encased in a @entity5 statue was stolen from a village temple in @entity7 in 1995 , state media reported . the mummy made international headlines last year when it first showcased at @entity11 in the @entity12 . the @entity13 in @entity15 province launched an investigation and found photos and historical records suggesting the statue belonged to a village temple where it was worshiped as an ancestor . the bureau will continue the investigation and report to national cultural authorities to seek repatriation in compliance with normal procedures , a spokesperson told the state - run @entity31 news agency on sunday . the statue , currently in possession of a @entity12 private collector , was being housed at the @entity37 @entity36 as a part of a @entity40 tour . the museum announced on their website that the mummy , originally scheduled to be on display until may , has been pulled from the exhibition at " the request of the loaning partner " -- the @entity11 . it 's unclear exactly when or how the statue made its way to a market in the @entity12 where a private buyer bought it in 1996 . @entity11 said the owner , who prefers to remain anonymous , had bought it legally . the mummy was discovered when the owner brought it to an expert for restoration . but it was n't until a team of researchers and scientists did a ct scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year , did they discover the mummy 's organs were missing . " we thought it would be lung tissue , but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with @entity1 characters , " said @entity68 , an archaeology curator from @entity11 . the mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in @entity1 inscriptions , revealing its identity as a @entity81 monk called @entity82 who may have practiced " self - mummification " to prepare for life after death . the process of self - mummification is a known tradition in countries like @entity90 , @entity7 and @entity91 , and was practiced more than a thousand years ago . the elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots . the few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered . " we suspect that for the first 200 years , the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a @entity81 temple in @entity7 ... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue , " said van @entity68 . researchers are still waiting on dna analysis results to help trace the mummy back to its exact location in @entity7 .
