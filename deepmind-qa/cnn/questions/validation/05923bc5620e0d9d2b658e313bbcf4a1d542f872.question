( @entity1 ) @entity0 , who was expelled from the @entity2 for spouting a racist chant at a fraternity activity , says he 's " deeply sorry . " " although i do n't deserve it , i want to ask for your forgiveness , " @entity0 said as he read from a prepared statement at a news conference on wednesday . " there are no excuses for my behavior . i never thought of myself as a racist . i never considered it a possibility . but the bottom line is that the words that were said in that chant were mean , hateful and racist . " flanked at the podium by @entity21 leaders who he 'd been meeting with at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity0 , who is white , said he planned to spend the rest of his life trying to undo the damage he 'd done . @entity0 's parents released a statement apologizing for his behavior earlier this month . but it was n't until wednesday that he spoke out himself . " some have wondered why i have n't spoken out publicly . the truth is , i 've had a mix of pain , shame , sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions , " he said . " i did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country first , until i came here to apologize to the community most directly impacted . " @entity0 read from a letter he 'd written the university 's president apologizing for his actions and said he 's committed to taking steps to prevent racism in the future . " over the past week or so , i 've met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words that i spoke on that bus , " @entity0 said . " meeting with a few people does not change what i did , but it has begun to change me , and my understanding of those hateful words . " his comments come more than two weeks after a nine - second clip surfaced showing party - bound fraternity members on a bus making racial slurs against blacks . in it , students at the now - disbanded @entity75 at the @entity2 clap , pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching . school officials expelled @entity0 and another student , @entity82 , because of their alleged " leadership role " in the racist chant . @entity82 has also apologized , saying he 'd made a " horrible mistake " and that the chant was " wrong and reckless . " @entity0 declined to answer reporters ' questions wednesday about how he learned the chant , but said he now knows that the words he used never should be repeated . " i 'm also upset and embarrassed that i failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant . i now have a clear understanding of what lives behind the words , " he said . " from this point forward , i will be the leader that i should have been on that bus and stand up against racism in any form . " @entity1 's @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .
