@entity2 ( @entity3 ) a newly released @entity1 video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an @entity8 spy . the video identifies the man as 19 - year - old @entity11 , an @entity8 citizen of @entity13 descent . in the video , @entity1 shows @entity11 's @entity8 passport and claims he 's an agent sent to infiltrate the group . the 19 - year - old 's family told @entity3 tuesday that he had no ties with the @entity19 , @entity8 's spy agency , and had , in fact , been recruited by @entity1 . " @entity11 told me and his brother that @entity1 took him , " according to @entity22 , his father . " they sent him money through the @entity26 . they said you will have girls , money , cars , villas , paradise , but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing . " it was n't long before @entity11 's family members did n't recognize him when they talked to him on @entity38 . the man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle . his father tried to help him get home , sending him money and even enlisting the @entity50 . but his son never made it back to @entity8 . about a month ago , @entity22 said , he was told his son was taken by @entity1 when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border . a video posted tuesday on @entity1 - affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be @entity11 on his knees , wearing an orange jumpsuit . an adult @entity1 fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him . the adult , speaking @entity63 , gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing . the child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots @entity11 in the forehead . the man immediately falls forward to the ground . the child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body . @entity79 said he 'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death . " i used to take care of him and babysit him when @entity85 went to work , " he said , crying . " @entity11 is not a brother . he is a son . " but he refuses to show the video to his parents , who still ca n't believe their son is dead . an issue last month of @entity1 ' @entity92 , @entity93 , included a purported interview with @entity11 and described his alleged work for the @entity8 spy agency . in the @entity1 video , @entity11 seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession , saying he is an @entity8 intelligence agent working for @entity19 , sent to infiltrate @entity1 . @entity11 's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video , forced to lie about ties to @entity8 intelligence . " @entity11 is not an agent . @entity11 does n't have a shekel . if he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life , " his mother , @entity106 , said . " we could have been living a different life and i would not be working cleaning houses so we can live . " this is n't the first time @entity1 has used children to drive home its message . an @entity1 propaganda video released in january -- one that @entity3 could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head . the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high . last august , a photo posted to @entity127 from an @entity1 stronghold showed a 7 - year - old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , " that 's my boy . " @entity1 has featured children as fighters before , calling them the " cubs of the caliphate " ( the adult jihadis call each other " lions " ) and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families . it has taken over schools to indoctrinate children . @entity145 says @entity1 and other extremist groups " have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions . " @entity3 's @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .
