( @entity3 ) @entity2 forces battling to wrest @entity4 from @entity5 are now in control of the city , prime minister @entity0 said tuesday on @entity8 . @entity9 , who is also the top military commander , said on state television that the city was liberated . while @entity0 has declared victory in the battle , pockets of fighting continues . @entity2 forces and @entity18 militias are taking part in clearing operations . @entity2 forces reached the center of @entity4 and hoisted the nation 's flag on top of the @entity26 , @entity0 said . fighting continued on the outskirts of the city , he added . @entity4 had been under @entity5 control since june . the push into @entity4 comes days after a series of @entity34 - led airstrikes targeted @entity5 targets around the city . the airstrikes made it possible for the @entity2 forces to move through the city . troops reported finding dozens of roadside bombs and booby - trapped buildings as they combed the city . at a @entity45 meeting before he declared @entity4 liberated , @entity0 was already calling the operation a success . " the success of the @entity4 experiment will be repeated in other areas because of the results it has achieved on the battlefield , on a humanitarian level , protecting civilians as much as possible , in addition to the low casualties amongst our security forces , " he said . @entity2 forces have tried multiple times to win back @entity4 since @entity5 conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive @entity65 caliphate but failed until now . this operation , however , was the biggest by the @entity2 military so far . " we managed to take ( @entity5 ) by surprise , " the prime minister said . " and our air force ... in addition to coalition air force , helping @entity2 forces , managed to deal severe blows to @entity5 and the enemies of @entity2 . and our ground forces with the blood of @entity2 , @entity2 alone with their own blood , were able to liberate this land . " the latest push began after @entity0 ordered @entity2 forces on march 1 to retake @entity4 and @entity81 . militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former @entity2 dictator @entity85 and is located about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of @entity86 . the @entity2 forces were aided by a coalition made up of mostly @entity18 militiamen and volunteers . the militia members , estimated to number around 20,000 , are backed by @entity91 . the offensive marked the first very overt participation of @entity91 advisers on the front lines . the victory in @entity4 sets the stage for @entity2 forces to take back an even bigger prize : @entity99 . @entity99 is @entity2 's second - biggest city and the site of one of its military 's biggest embarrassments , when @entity2 troops dropped their weapons and ran rather than defend their posts last june . a @entity34 official said in february that up to 25,000 @entity2 troops plan to return to @entity99 in april or may and , ideally , win it back . this comment came days after @entity0 told the @entity111 that while there 's still work to do , he felt confident @entity2 could recapture the key northern city . @entity3 's @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .
