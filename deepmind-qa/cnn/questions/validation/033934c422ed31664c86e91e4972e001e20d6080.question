( @entity1 ) there is only one likely outcome for @entity4 's current military offensive to reclaim @entity5 : defeat for @entity7 . the campaign to restore central government authority over the restive @entity11 province is seen as both symbolic and strategic for @entity4 which has invested too much already for it to afford losing this battle . @entity7 are said to have booby - trapped much of the city in an attempt to slow down the government assault . however , the task at hand has been made easier for @entity4 given that most civilians in @entity5 have already fled -- both to @entity21 in the north as well as south to @entity4 -- leaving behind mostly @entity7 jihadists who defend the city , according to @entity26 constitutional specialist @entity25 , who is from the city . initial reports of the multi-pronged attack on @entity5 have been encouraging . @entity26 forces have already cleared a number of areas on the outskirts and are expected to continue advancing towards the city center as both heavy artillery and helicopter gunships pound @entity7 militants who have taken up defensive positions . another crucial element for the success of this battle will be the varied make - up of the groups involved in the fight . the joint @entity26 forces fighting to retake @entity5 include @entity26 troops , members of the mainly @entity49 paramilitary force , members of the @entity52 brigades , and other @entity54 tribal fighters . the offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all . although the campaign is @entity26 - led , help from outside is also going to play an important role . though the @entity60 has not conducted any airstrikes in this campaign yet , this may well change as the battle develops . @entity65 , in stark contrast to the @entity60 , provided @entity26 with immediate and much - needed military assistance when the security crisis escalated last june . the @entity65 are heavily invested in this current campaign and are also not going to let the @entity26 lose . unlike in @entity69 , the @entity60 and @entity65 both share a common enemy and a common friend in @entity26 , but due to wider political considerations neither @entity72 nor @entity73 will admit that there is any form of tacit cooperation in @entity26 . however , the campaign for @entity5 is just another front where such cooperation is likely to be already happening behind the scenes . @entity4 will make use of @entity60 intelligence that will almost certainly be shared with the @entity65 officers who are advising the @entity26 army . general @entity86 , the commander of the @entity87 , who has played a key role in the fight against @entity7 , was reported to be near @entity5 just hours after the military campaign was officially launched . @entity65 provides military advice , support and weapons not just through the central government in @entity4 but also directly to a number of increasingly powerful @entity49 militia groups that now operate under the state - sponsored paramilitary committee , the @entity97 , known as the " popular mobilization units . " the two key @entity26 leaders of this paramilitary command , @entity102 and @entity103 , were also pictured together with general @entity104 , the commander of @entity26 's elite @entity105 . though there are few civilians left in @entity5 , all eyes will be on the @entity26 security forces -- and especially the @entity49 militias --- to see if abuses are carried out once the enemy is routed . prime minister @entity113 already warned the @entity115 fighters to protect civilians and properties in the area and also gave the " misled " @entity7 militants a last chance to lay down their arms before the troops made their advance . the battle is an especially emotional one for the @entity49 soldiers and fighters as @entity5 is the site of the @entity129 massacre last june , where 1,700 @entity49 soldiers were captured , separated from their @entity54 comrades and then summarily executed in an atrocity that was documented by @entity7 as a powerful propaganda film . however , it is encouraging that both @entity49 and @entity54 fighters are supporting the army in its effort to defeat @entity7 . the cooperation between @entity49 and @entity54 fighters will be crucial not just in the ongoing offensive in @entity5 but will also set the stage for further cooperation in the strategic campaign to recapture @entity143 . politically , these groups may not see eye - to - eye and of course there remain deep ethno - sectarian tensions in @entity26 and beyond , but regardless of these differences they all view @entity7 as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated . to be sure , the @entity54 tribesmen involved in this campaign are more anti-isis than they are pro-government , but that they can work with the pro-government @entity49 militias is both good news and good progress for a country believed to be ripping itself apart along ethno - sectarian lines .

both shia and @placeholder groups view @entity7 as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated , he adds
