( @entity1 ) @entity0 will begin sunday 's @entity2 in pole position after dominating qualifying in torrential conditions . the @entity7 driver , and current world champion , beat @entity10 's @entity9 into second place who himself snatched a front row berth away from countryman @entity14 in the final seconds of qualifying . " it was a fantastic job for the team to have us both up here again , " @entity0 said , referring to teammate @entity14 's third place finish . tension ? initially it had appeared that the tensions that had marked last season 's title race had re-emerged . @entity0 aborted a flying lap after it looked like @entity14 had blocked him . but both men played down the incident in the post-qualifying press conference . @entity14 , for his part , was more annoyed that @entity9 had managed to steal second place at the death . " i just did n't drive well enough , i 'm annoyed by that , " @entity14 said . " third place is not good enough . " deluge @entity35 took place amid spectacular thunderstorms which delayed qualifying by half an hour . indeed , @entity39 has become known for such conditions . the 2012 race was halted for an hour and in 2009 abandoned altogether and awarded to @entity42 after 31 laps . but @entity0 made light work of the conditions , looked the quickest throughout and will try to build on his season opening win in @entity46 . yet perhaps the most impressive performance of the day came further down the grid . @entity50 's 17 year old driver @entity49 will start the race in sixth in only his second race for the team .
