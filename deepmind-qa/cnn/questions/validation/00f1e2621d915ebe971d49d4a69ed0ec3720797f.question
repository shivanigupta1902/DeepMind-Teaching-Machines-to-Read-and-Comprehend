( @entity2 ) @entity1 prosecutors have asked @entity4 's legal representatives whether the @entity6 founder would consent to be interviewed in @entity7 and have his dna taken via a swab . @entity4 has been holed up in the @entity10 since june 2012 to avoid extradition to @entity1 , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another . @entity1 prosecutors have previously balked at coming to @entity15 to question @entity4 . however , a number of the crimes @entity4 is suspected of will be subject to a statute of limitation in august 2015 , according to a statement from @entity21 , the director of public prosecutions . " if @entity4 gives his consent , the prosecutor will promptly submit a request for legal assistance to the @entity15 authorities to further continue the investigation , " the statement said . a request will also be made to the @entity32 authorities for permission to " perform investigative measures " at its @entity7 embassy , the statement said . @entity32 granted @entity4 political asylum in 2012 . @entity4 's defense lawyer , @entity37 , said he called @entity4 on friday morning with the news from the prosecution authority -- and that in principle they viewed the request positively . " i think i woke him up , but he knew i was calling with news about the case since i called so early , " @entity37 said . " he was , of course , very happy that something is finally happening but he is irritated that it has taken such a long time . " this is a step that @entity4 and his team have been requesting for four years , @entity37 said . @entity21 explained the logic behind the @entity1 authorities ' change of approach in her statement . " my view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the @entity32 embassy in @entity7 would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in @entity1 in any case should there be a trial in the future , " @entity21 said . " this assessment remains unchanged . now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without @entity4 being present in @entity1 . " the @entity79 national has not been charged and denies the claims . he 's said he fears @entity1 would extradite him to the @entity81 , where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through @entity6 . @entity37 said @entity4 's legal team would travel over to @entity7 as soon as possible to discuss @entity21 's request and that it expects to respond next week . " the problem is that there are two more countries involved in this request so it might take some time to make all this happen , " @entity37 said . @entity37 also said friday 's development was not a great surprise since @entity1 's @entity94 had last week asked the prosecutor general for an opinion on the case . " we think that the prosecutor general , who has taken over the case , probably told prosecutor @entity21 to interview @entity4 in @entity7 , " he said . @entity4 has previously said the arrest warrant should be thrown out because , in part , @entity1 authorities declined to interview him at the @entity32 embassy , thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he said should have concluded long ago . @entity7 's @entity105 said last month that the cost of the operation to guard the embassy to prevent @entity4 fleeing had spiraled to more than 10 million pounds ( $ 15.3 million . ) overall @entity2 's @entity110 contributed to this report

@entity1 prosecutors will ask @placeholder 's lawyers if they can question him in @entity7
