( @entity0 ) she was the first person to contract @entity2 in the @entity3 , and now she 's suing the hospital where she got infected . @entity5 , a nurse at @entity6 , filed a lawsuit monday against the hospital 's parent company , @entity8 . she claims the company made her " a symbol of corporate neglect -- a casualty of a hospital system 's failure to prepare for a known and impending medical crisis . " @entity8 ignored @entity2 warnings , its chief medical officer " made numerous patently false statements to @entity27 , " and the company " wholly failed to ensure that appropriate polices , procedures , and equipment were in place , " leaving health care providers untrained , unprotected and at risk for exposure , the lawsuit says . " i was hoping that @entity8 would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital , and the things they did n't do that led to me getting infected with @entity2 , " @entity29 said in a statement . " but that did n't happen and i felt i was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help . " the company 's ceo , @entity40 , sent a letter to employees monday night after news of the lawsuit broke . " @entity5 and so many others of you served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of @entity2 to arrive in a @entity3 hospital 's emergency room , " the statement read . " @entity8 values our strong culture of caring and compassion , and we view all employees as part of our family . that 's why we have continued to support @entity5 both during and after her illness , and it 's why she is still a member of our team . " according to the suit , the hospital chain failed to provide proper training to handle @entity2 . @entity29 contracted the disease last fall while treating @entity67 , who started showing symptoms after arriving in @entity69 from @entity70 . " in a cruel twist , after watching mr. @entity67 go through the horrific and painful course of the disease as she desperately tried to save his life , @entity5 herself was diagnosed with @entity2 just two days after mr. @entity67 's life was taken by it , " the lawsuit states . because the hospital initially discharged @entity67 when he arrived seeking treatment , it hurt his chances of beating the virus , the lawsuit says . " had @entity8 heeded the @entity84 and other warnings and ensured its hospitals were ready for @entity2 , mr. @entity67 would have had the best opportunity to possibly survive , " it says . @entity29 also claims that the hospital failed to provide her with the necessary protective equipment , despite @entity84 warnings . " based on what she could learn from the @entity92 , on the first day she cared for mr. @entity67 , @entity5 put on a regular isolation gown covering her front and back , double gloves , a surgical mask with plastic shield and double booties . importantly , @entity5 's neck and hair remained exposed . @entity5 was not even ( provided ) disposable scrubs or a change of clothes . she had to wear the scrubs she wore that first day home , taking out of the hospital clothing that was potentially carrying the virus , " the lawsuit says . when her mother learned she was treating @entity67 , she tried to persuade her to call in sick or even quit , but @entity29 replied , " @entity109 , i ca n't abandon him . he is my patient . it 's my job . i 'm going back , " according to the lawsuit . @entity8 spokesman @entity113 issued a statement in response to the lawsuit : " @entity5 served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of @entity2 to arrive in a @entity3 hospital 's emergency room . @entity8 has a strong culture of caring and compassion , and we view all our employees as part of our family . that 's why we have continued to support @entity5 both during and after her illness , and it 's why she is still a member of our team . as distressing as the lawsuit is to us , we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with @entity5 . " comparing the conditions facing nurses to what one would expect in a poorly developed country , the suit further states that after @entity67 died , @entity29 was told she was at " no risk " for @entity2 " and that she could freely see her friends and family . " two days later , she found out she had @entity2 . " @entity8 quickly learned that @entity5 and her dog @entity141 had enormous public support and sympathy . so @entity8 began trying to use @entity5 as a pr tool to save its plummeting image . while @entity5 laid in isolation , heavily medicated and facing a potentially gruesome death , @entity8 had its @entity150 department calling @entity5 . the @entity152 was trying to release information and use @entity5 as part of its @entity8 - corporate - driven # @entity156 campaign , " the lawsuit says . @entity29 's lawsuit also says @entity8 violated her privacy by sharing her medical records . in his letter to employees , @entity40 said the company had @entity29 's permission to release information . " @entity8 was sensitive to @entity5 's privacy , and we adhered to @entity167 ( @entity167 ) rules in determining what information to share publicly , " the ceo said . " we had @entity5 's consent to share the information about her that was released . " another nurse treating @entity67 , @entity173 , also contracted @entity2 . both nurses recovered after being sent to hospitals specially equipped and staffed to handle @entity2 -- @entity29 at the @entity176 in @entity177 , and @entity178 at @entity179 in @entity180 . @entity29 is still employed and is getting a paycheck from @entity8 , but has not returned to work , @entity0 affiliate @entity181 said . she is still suffering fatigue and body aches , but her lawyer told the affiliate it 's not clear whether the ailments are from @entity2 or from the experimental drugs @entity29 received . she also experiences anxiety and frequent nightmares and suffers from the stigma of being the @entity2 nurse and she may not nurse again , the lawsuit says " professionally , she doubts whether she can ever be a critical care nurse again -- in part because of the emotional stress and anxiety over the trauma she experienced and in part because of the fear and stigma that follows her . so despite only just beginning to pursue her dream of a career in critical care nursing , @entity5 is now faced with the possibility of never returning to her passion , " the lawsuit says . the lawsuit seeks damages for past and future physical pain , mental anguish , physical impairment , loss of enjoyment of life , medical expenses , loss of earning capacity and loss of reputation the lawsuit says . it does not set an amount for damages sought . " the fact is , i 'm facing a number of issues with regard to my health and my career and the lawsuit provides a way to address them , " @entity29 said in her statement . " but more importantly , it will help uncover the truth of what happened , and educate all health care providers and administrators about ways to be better prepared for the next public health emergency . " i particularly want to express my continued sympathy to the family of mr. @entity67 , as it was my privilege to care for him . i also want to acknowledge my fellow nurses , and the many friends , family and strangers for their ongoing concern and support . " @entity0 's @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .
