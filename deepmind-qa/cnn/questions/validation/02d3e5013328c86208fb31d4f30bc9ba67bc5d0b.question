@entity2 ( @entity3 ) @entity1 's own words may determine whether he lives or dies , even if he never speaks a word at his trial . the admitted @entity7 bomber has sat in silence as people who lost limbs sobbed or glared at him from the witness stand . he slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail - packed pressure cooker bombs exploded , killing three people , claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others . he did n't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court . at issue : was @entity1 a terrorist looking to punish the @entity29 for policies he believed were harmful to @entity31 ? or , was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older , more radical brother ? the defense team tried to portray @entity1 as a confused college kid who , like countless others , watches @entity39 and cracks crass jokes . " i wan na study a broad or two , " he posted on his @entity43 account as @ @entity44 . he jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the @entity48 rabbit , and about " whale watching " outside a @entity51 's fast - food restaurant . @entity52 , a member of his defense team , tried tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would - be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise . his brother was dead and police knew who he was ; they were scouring the @entity2 suburb of @entity64 for @entity1 when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the @entity66 , a fishing boat dry - docked in a @entity64 backyard . he hid for hours before being discovered . bleeding , he picked up a pencil and wrote what assistant u.s. attorney @entity70 called his " manifesto . " @entity1 wrote he was jealous that his brother , @entity73 , had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior ; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police . the indictment against him says @entity1 helped in his brother 's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police . about the bombings , @entity1 wrote on the boat that he did n't enjoy killing innocent civilians , but that circumstances excused it . " the @entity88 is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that , " he wrote . " know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven , now how can you compete with that . we are promised victory and we will surely get it . " streaks of blood cover portions of his message . more than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words . so ended one of the biggest manhunts in @entity29 history . while in the boat , he wrote that he could n't stand to see the @entity29 government " go unpunished " for killing @entity31 . " we @entity31 are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all . " he ended with : " now i do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in @entity118 but due to said " -- the word was lost to a bullet hole -- " it is allowed . " @entity1 's connections : who 's who judge @entity123 viewed the boat tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat " in context " to the jury . he turned down requests by the media to accompany him . the defense said the government only presented about 45 tweets out of about 1,100 . many were benign , about girls , cars and food as well as sleeping and disliking studying , the defense argued . on monday , @entity140 agent @entity139 testified about two @entity43 accounts used by @entity1 . one account shows he tweeted on the day of the april 15 , 2013 , bombing : " @entity143 , stay safe people " his last tweet was on april 17 . he sent it while on the run : " i 'm a stress free kind of guy " his other account carried seven tweets , including this : " strive to be a better muslim , be greedy with your time , devote most of it to the @entity158 for it is his satisfaction that you need # islam " the jury also has now seen @entity1 in videos , trailing his brother onto @entity165 . both carried heavy backpacks . he paused for four minutes , standing next to a tree in front of the @entity170 . in front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race . he put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call . timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath when his brother 's bomb went off a block away , heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise . and there was @entity191 walking through the crowd , looking back over his shoulder as his own bomb went off 12 seconds later . @entity195 , an 8 - year - old standing in the line of kids , took the full brunt of the blast , which tore him apart . the bombs went off at 2:49 and 2:50 p.m. , about the same time as he exchanged phone calls with his brother . the next video showed @entity1 in the crowd running . other videos show him carrying on as usual : buying milk and swiping his card at his college gym . but @entity140 agents were already in pursuit , collecting store security videos and looking for somebody suspicious in the marathon crowd . by wednesday night , authorities had a good idea who they were looking for . by thursday night , his photo had been released to the public . by the next morning , his brother was dead , and @entity1 was hiding in the boat , writing of martyrdom and paradise .
