( @entity2 ) @entity1 foreign minister @entity0 says the government is seeking to confirm reports that an @entity1 teenager has carried out a suicide attack on behalf of @entity7 in @entity8 . " i can confirm that the @entity1 government is currently seeking to independently verify reports that 18 - year - old @entity13 teenager @entity12 has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in the @entity15 , " she told reporters . " if these reports are confirmed , this is another tragic example of a young @entity1 being lured to a senseless and violent death by a brutal terrorist organization that is intent on imposing suffering and misery not only in @entity8 and @entity22 but beyond . " on wednesday , @entity7 claimed that " @entity23 , " along with four other foreign fighters , had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of @entity28 in @entity8 . the claim , issued on a @entity31 account associated with the @entity33 provincial division of @entity7 , was accompanied by a series of 20 images , including a photo of a young man who looked like @entity12 . the image appeared to show @entity12 at the wheel of a car with the caption , " @entity23 ( may @entity42 accept him ) , the attacker on the @entity44 . " the other attackers hailed from @entity47 , @entity22 , @entity48 and the @entity49 , the @entity31 account claimed . @entity51 police said @entity12 first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year . a search of his family 's home in the @entity13 suburb of @entity58 following his disappearance uncovered chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device , police said , although no actual bombs were found . @entity0 said @entity12 's passport had been canceled in october on the advice of @entity1 security agencies . @entity1 media have reported that @entity12 kept a since - deleted blog , written under his alias @entity23 . entitled " from @entity13 to @entity28 : my journey , " it reportedly detailed his transition from an " atheist school student in affluent @entity13 to a soldier of the @entity73 preparing to sacrifice my life for @entity75 . " the blog reportedly described a plan to attack targets in @entity13 , after an initial attempt to move to @entity8 or @entity22 failed . " this plan involved launching a string of bombings across @entity13 , targeting foreign consulates and political / military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar , " he wrote , according to the @entity81 . member of @entity12 's family have linked the teen 's radicalization to the loss of his mother from cancer . " he 's just a young boy that went looking for something after he lost someone very very dear to him , his mother , " his aunt , @entity101 , told @entity2 affiliate seven on monday . a former classmate of @entity12 's from @entity13 's @entity107 described the teen on @entity109 as a " shy kid who did n't like to be disturbed " . " one day , he randomly got angry at me and tried to punch me , " he posted . " always keep an eye out on the quiet ones . " a former penpal of @entity12 told @entity2 he cut off communication with the teenager about two years ago , when @entity12 started posting @entity75 extremist messages on his @entity109 page . the friend , who requested not to be named , said he first met @entity101 on the website interpals.net about seven years ago . they shared a love for soccer -- @entity12 was a supporter of @entity123 -- and became penpals . @entity12 told him about his mother 's death , and confided that he was fighting with his family , because they would not allow him to go overseas to study . the penpal said he started noticing a change in @entity12 's behavior when the teen started posting " things that supported @entity135 " on @entity109 . " i got scared , " the friend said . " my friends here told me that maybe i should stop talking to him . " he blocked @entity101 on the social networking site about two years ago . after a while , he said , he got curious about how his old penpal was doing . " i thought he was my friend . i wanted to make sure he was okay ... i sent him an email saying ' are you well ? ' but he never wrote back . " @entity0 said that 90 @entity1 citizens are in @entity8 and @entity22 fighting on the side of @entity7 , and that at least 20 @entity1 have been killed in the conflict . the passports of some 100 @entity1 had been canceled on national security grounds , she said . @entity0 appealed to young @entity1 " not to fall victim to this brutal terrorist organization , to not be lured into believing that they 're embarking on some adventure or some romantic endeavor . " " this is a brutal organization dedicated to creating misery and hardship , " she said . " its activities of beheadings and executions and crucifixions all take us back to the dark ages . " @entity1 prime minister @entity168 addressed @entity12 's alleged suicide attack in comments to the press thursday . this is a horrific situation -- an absolutely horrific situation -- and it shows the lure of this death cult to impressionable youngsters , " he said . " it 's very , very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking alien and extreme ideology . " last week , two @entity1 teen brothers were arrested at @entity182 on suspicion of trying to leave the country to join @entity7 . @entity2 's @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .
