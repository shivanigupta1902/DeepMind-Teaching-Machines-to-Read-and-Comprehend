( @entity0 ) four years ago i was laughed out of the room when i said to a group of friends : " pretty soon guys are going to decide their lives are more important than playing in the @entity7 . and they are going to stop playing . " my friends accused me of going soft , being an elitist , being overly pc . today , i 'm certain they are not saying those things about the talented 49er linebacker @entity12 , the latest nfler to quit . he 's 24 years old and the first player to retire directly because he wanted to avoid the traumatic brain injuries that have been linked to playing football . @entity12 played just one @entity7 season . " i just honestly want to do what 's best for my health , " he told @entity19 's " @entity22 . " " from what i 've researched and what i 've experienced , i do n't think it 's worth the risk . " he added : " i just thought to myself , ' what am i doing ? is this how i 'm going to live my adult life , banging my head , especially with what i 've learned and knew about the dangers ? ' " his teammate , @entity34 linebacker @entity33 , made the decision to walk away last week , and you ca n't help but think his decision might have influenced @entity12 . @entity33 says he is n't really sure what he 'll do next , but he knows he wo n't play another game in the @entity7 . although fans around the globe are begging the 30 - year - old , seven - time pro bowler to " unretire , " @entity33 said his nagging foot and ankle injuries , and a desire for a happy life are why he walked away . " i have no regrets , " said a tearful @entity33 in his press conference last week . " i gave this game everything i had and i am truly blessed . ... honestly , i pay attention to guys when they 're finished playing , walking around like they 've got no hips and they ca n't play with their kids . they can barely walk . " people see that and they feel sorry , " @entity33 said . " but they do n't realize it 's because he played a few extra years . " @entity33 , who has a degree in criminology from @entity63 , is a wise man . and while many sports fans are in shock that any guy lucky enough to play in the @entity7 would just walk away from fame and wealth , it sounds to me like @entity33 has his priorities right . it 's refreshing . and @entity33 is not alone . at a time of year when most football fans are consumed by trade rumors and free agency moves , several other high - profile players have decided to hang up their cleats . and what 's surprising is how young they are : at 27 , @entity82 linebacker @entity81 was soon to step into the crazy world of free agency , where he was sure to be in demand by many teams . it looked like he was just about to get his huge payday . but instead , he 's leaving the game . unlike @entity33 , @entity90 had n't been plagued by injuries , at least not yet . and he 'd only missed one game in the past three seasons . so why did he leave ? he wants to do other things , he said . @entity96 quarterback @entity95 , 26 , announced he 's also retiring after just four seasons . another pro bowler who had been haunted by injuries , running back @entity100 , 29 , called it quits in @entity102 recently . he lasted nine years . young , intelligent and charismatic , " @entity105 " was adored by fans until , like so many other elite players , he was slowed down by injuries . @entity106 - @entity100 , whom i worked with a lot when he was starting out in the league , is a smart and personable guy . it was clear when i met him that he was talented enough to succeed at anything he pursued . " football has been a central part of my life for the past 24 years , " @entity100 wrote when announcing his retirement on @entity113 . " but now i 'm excited about and looking forward to the next chapter of my life . " who knows , maybe @entity105 is the next @entity119 ? that former @entity121 's successful exit from football has inspired so many younger players . @entity119 's path has empowered others to value themselves beyond football . every season , i get calls from nflers who want my help finding a career after football . " how do i do what @entity136 did ; that 's what i want to do , " they say . once dubbed the " sack master , " @entity119 has transformed himself into such a daytime tv media darling you would think he was born to co-host @entity144 's " @entity143 . " but even he had to decide when to quit the game before it got the best of him . it took 15 years . i will never forget how hobbled @entity119 looked one early morning when an @entity19 crew showed up at his door to do a " day - in - life " story on his off day . bruised and still bloody that morning , he could barely get out of bed . usually loquacious , he had trouble even talking because his swollen jaw was locked shut . he could n't even brush his teeth properly . shave ? forget it : hands too gnarly . and it was clear he had a severe migraine working his brain . there were very few laughs that day . @entity119 was barely 30 then , and he looked like a defeated , old man . now , every time i see him smiling for the cameras , i think how blessed he is to be healthy and enjoying his life after football . so maybe there is another way out for young players who are now better informed about the dangers of the game . just maybe all the debates about the ugly side of football -- concussions , brain injuries , depression and suicides -- have done some good , after all . today , a guy like @entity33 can walk away from the game a happy man : " if i want to go fishing tomorrow , i 'm going to go fishing . ... if i want to go home and watch my little brother play baseball , i can go to do that . ... life is amazing right now . "
