( @entity0 ) they 're some of the toughest athletes on the planet , saying goodbye to loved ones for almost a year , as they traverse the globe 's oceans . hardened @entity7 sailors must sleep in four - hour shifts , and survive on little more than freeze dried food and chocolate bars , if they hope to win the event . the prestigious competition kicked off from @entity13 , @entity14 , in october last year , and will finish nine months later in @entity15 , @entity16 . @entity18 skipper @entity17 , spoke about the journey so far . this is the 45 - year - old @entity21 's third @entity7 . " as the leading offshore race -- and the one that is most vulnerable to nature and synonymous with danger -- it could be described as the ' @entity28 of sailing . ' " " we trained for six months , covering 16,000 sea miles . as a team , we usually do three weeks on the boat , one week off . when not offshore , we train six - days - a - week in the gym . " " everybody has four hours on deck , followed by four hours off when you eat and sleep . on the off - watch , you still have to get on deck and help for any sail changes , so it is quite disturbed . " " mainly freeze dried food with some savory and sweet treats like beef jerky , dried fruits , one chocolate bar per day , and nuts . " " i 'm the skipper , so overall in charge of safety and performance . i 'm involved with all strategic decisions with my navigator , @entity54 , and i run one of the watches when on deck . @entity58 , i 'm also busy with media duties and management of our 15 shore team members . " " it can be an emotional roller coaster and it can be tough not to take things personally if they do n't go well . at sea , emotions can range from frustration , boredom , elation , being scared , loneliness ... it is important to try to keep a level head at all times -- especially if you are the skipper ! " " i have great respect for the ocean . it will always win in the end so you must respect it . i am also saddened by all the man - made debris we see in the ocean as we sail round the world . " " a professional sailor with a fierce determination to win . someone who is prepared to put the needs of the team above his own , and who is prepared to commit over 12 months of his life to being away from normal life .
