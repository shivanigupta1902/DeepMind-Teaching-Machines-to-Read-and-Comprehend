( @entity4 ) the @entity0 , which is the largest sponsor of @entity2 troops in the @entity3 , says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts , as claims have been made it has n't done enough . in the first interview about allegations of abuse in @entity17 church - sponsored scouting troops , @entity11 told @entity4 that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse . " we feel like there is really no other organization that we know of -- a church or something like a church -- that does as much as we do , " @entity11 said . " we have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse , and we train our people , we teach our people , we work with leaders , we provide materials online and in hard copy . " over several months , @entity4 examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts . but @entity11 said the church today is proactive , even constructing its buildings " in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur . " " for instance , if you walk down the hallway in an @entity0 chapel , a @entity17 church , and look at the sunday school classes , you 're going to see windows in the doorways into those sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by , " he said . the interview with @entity11 followed a @entity4 investigation into the case of @entity59 , who was sexually abused by his scoutmaster , a member of the @entity0 , beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998 , according to the lawsuit @entity59 filed against the church and the @entity63 . the scoutmaster , @entity64 , had been forced in resign from scouting in the early 1990s after reports surfaced that he failed to report a fellow scoutmaster who was engaged in homosexual activities . that scoutmaster ended up going to prison for sexual assaults on minors . @entity64 's name was added to the @entity63 's ineligible volunteer files , which are widely known as the " perversion files . " the documents , which were made public in 2012 , are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity . however , three years after being kicked out of scouting , @entity64 was allowed to rejoin the scouts after getting letters of recommendation attesting to his character . one of those letters was from @entity64 's influential mormon bishop @entity87 , who wrote that @entity64 was " highly respected and liked . " @entity88 , who is now retired , declined to speak to @entity4 . but in a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit last year , he acknowledged that he would not have written the letter knowing what he later found out about @entity64 . the lawsuit charged that @entity64 " actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation . " @entity64 eventually was convicted of molesting @entity59 . he is now in prison for violating probation in the @entity59 case . @entity102 , who is @entity59 's lawyer , said what happened in the case is outrageous . " this case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the @entity0 church , and the reason i say that is because the @entity0 church knew that @entity64 , this pedophile , was already kicked out of scouting by the @entity63 , " @entity102 said . however , church attorney @entity112 said it was the @entity63 organization that should have done something . " if the @entity63 had disclosed to @entity88 the information they had in their files , there is no way that @entity64 would have ever become a scoutmaster , and he would have been subject to excommunication by the church , " @entity112 said . in a statement to @entity4 , the @entity63 said @entity64 was removed from scouting " for reasons unrelated to child abuse . " the group added , " our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient , inappropriate or wrong . we extend our deepest apologies to victims and their families . " read the full response from the @entity63 the case ended last year with a confidential settlement paid to @entity59 , who is now 31 . all but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and @entity63 have been settled . @entity64 was sentenced to probation in 2000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting @entity59 . while on probation , he was arrested for possession of child pornography and was sentenced in 2012 to 15 to 30 years in prison . " any case is alarming to me . it 's a tragedy , " @entity11 said . " i 'm a father . i have seven children , four boys and three girls . i have 19 grandchildren . the thought of one of them as a child or youth being abused is absolutely horrific to me . " asked what he would say to @entity59 , @entity11 said , " i say to him and anyone else who has been abused in the church or other churches -- i 'm sorry that you 've gone through what you 've gone through . it 's a horrible thing for anyone to be abused . no child , no youth should ever have to go through that .
