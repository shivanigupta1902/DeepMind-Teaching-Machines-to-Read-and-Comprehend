( @entity0 ) @entity2 's @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has taken delivery of the @entity4 , the largest @entity2 military vessel to see service since @entity7 the warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the @entity11 naval base near @entity12 , also home to the @entity15 's @entity14 . the @entity4 has a crew of 470 , and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones ( 24,000 tonnes at full load , according to military publication @entity18 ) , it is as large as the storied @entity24 - class battleships which fought @entity26 naval forces in the @entity28 theater of @entity7 the wreck of one of the two @entity24 - class battleships , the @entity30 , was discovered early in march 2015 by @entity33 co-founder @entity32 . at 241 meters ( 791 feet ) in length , the @entity4 is 51 meters ( 167 ft ) longer than the @entity35 , another helicopter carrier which was , until now , the @entity38 's largest vessel . regional neighbors and rivals questioned the legitimacy of such a ship for purely defensive purposes , pointing out that , due to its size and deck configuration it could be repurposed as an aircraft carrier -- a class banned under @entity2 's pacifist constitution . " the @entity4 proves that @entity2 has the technical capabilities and demand to develop aircraft carriers . it 's also possible that @entity2 may explore the possibility during the @entity4 's service , " @entity52 , a @entity53 - based military expert , told the @entity57 state - backed @entity55 newspaper . however , defense minister gen @entity60 told reporters in @entity12 that the @entity1 did not intend to use it in this way . " we are not thinking about using this as an aircraft carrier , " he said , saying that the lack of hangers and service bays , along with a deck unsuitable for takeoffs and landings , meant that the @entity4 was n't designed for fixed - wing aircraft . he said that it needed to be as large as it is so it could host joint operations and act as a command center . he insisted that the new addition to @entity2 's maritime forces was designed for peaceful purposes . " the vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including peacekeeping operations , international disaster relief and aid . " he added that its helicopter capabilities -- it can host seven anti-submarine patrol helicopters , plus two rescue and transport helicopters , the @entity91 reported -- would aid in the detection of sophisticated @entity57 submarines . @entity2 , along with the @entity94 and @entity95 , is engaged in territorial disputes with @entity57 over the sovereignty of islands in the @entity99 , and @entity100 , a defense analyst at the @entity101 in @entity2 , says that , in combination with @entity2 's other helicopter carriers , the @entity4 could be used to " regain remote islets . " he also downplayed @entity57 's suggestions that the size of the @entity4 represented an escalation of @entity2 's military ambitions , telling @entity0 that although it is the biggest @entity2 military ship since @entity7 , it is only a fifth of the size of the @entity113 @entity112 . " it would cost five times @entity2 's current defense spending for the @entity116 to have an independent operational capability . the @entity2 public would not take that kind of risk , " he said . the commissioning of the @entity4 comes amid heightened tensions between @entity2 and its neighbors @entity57 and @entity124 . in july . @entity2 prime minister @entity125 allowed for a reinterpreting of @entity2 's constitution , paving the way for more active military engagement overseas . the @entity57 government has also invited the @entity2 leader to attend a ceremony in the @entity57 capital in september to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the @entity7 . @entity2 's handling of its wartime aggression is frequently criticized by @entity57 and other @entity139 nations -- it is often accused of downplaying its actions during the war . @entity57 foreign ministry spokeswoman @entity142 said tuesday that the @entity57 government had contacted " all relevant countries " with a view to attending . the @entity2 @entity147 newspaper said that , as the celebrations will feature a military parade , @entity125 is " unlikely to attend . " it quoted an unnamed @entity152 official as saying : " while the @entity2 government is demanding @entity57 improve the transparency of its defense spending , attendance of the prime minister is impossible . " @entity2 chief cabinet secretary @entity158 has previously said that @entity57 should work on developing a future - looking cooperative relationship with @entity2 , rather than highlighting @entity2 's previous , 70 - year - old indiscretions . @entity0 's @entity162 in @entity161 contributed to this report .

critics in neighboring countries say the ship could contravene @placeholder 's pacifist constitution
