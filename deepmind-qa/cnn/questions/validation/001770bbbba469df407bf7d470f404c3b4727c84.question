( @entity1 ) @entity0 lifted his first trophy since last year 's @entity3 and closed in on a long - standing @entity5 record sunday by claiming the @entity7 crown . @entity9 legend @entity8 leads the way with 49 wins in clay - court tournaments , but today 's " @entity0 " drew nearer to the leading mark by winning his 46th title in @entity15 . he also claimed his 65th title from 93 tour - level finals , breaking out of a tie with legends @entity19 and @entity21 for fifth place in the all - time list . @entity0 has been hampered by injury and illness since his @entity3 triumph last june and lost out to @entity27 in the semifinals of the @entity29 last week . it was a dispiriting defeat -- his first in a clay - court semifinal for 12 years -- but , moving from @entity33 to @entity9 , the @entity30 was largely untroubled in reaching the final and duly swept aside home player @entity35 6 - 4 6 - 1 in the @entity36 . @entity0 was playing in the first event for the first time in 10 years and his victory is a morale - booster after going out early in @entity41 and exiting the @entity42 ahead of his clay - court swing in @entity44 . the 28 - year - old from @entity46 took his career record against @entity35 , who was playing his 20th career final , to 6 - 1 and was never seriously troubled in the title match . the only thing to delay him was multiple rain delays which had the players scurrying on and off the court . a single break of service gave him the opener but he pulled clear immediately in the second and three further breaks saw him wrap up victory in just short of an hour and a half of action . @entity0 is the seventh successive @entity66 winner of the @entity68 event , and it is a boost for his preparations for his challenge for a remarkable 10th @entity3 title in may .
