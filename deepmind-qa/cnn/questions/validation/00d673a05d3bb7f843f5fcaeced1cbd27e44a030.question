( @entity0 ) are your heroes disappointing you ? you 're not alone . most people yearn for role models , for someone to admire and emulate . but then sometimes : crash ! unless the superheroes perform their awe - inspiring work in the comic books or the movies , they eventually slide off the pedestal ; or perhaps they get smashed down to the ground , breaking into too many pieces to repair . the admirer is left heartbroken or disillusioned . if you want to admire someone fully , you should not look too closely . if you want to admire them smartly , you should brace yourself for at least some measure of disappointment . in the political arena , the season of scrutiny and revelations is just getting started with @entity26 and her email practices as secretary of state under the microscope . after a press conference at the @entity31 on tuesday , worries that she is too secretive and calculating are emerging again . for some diehard supporters , this is all about @entity34 - hating @entity36 politics . but to people who may have held @entity34 as a model and inspiration , it may raise doubts . is @entity26 a hero or is she not to be trusted ? or , is there an altogether different answer ? for me , two individuals in particular were once important heroes . a couple of weeks ago , during a trip to the @entity48 , i had the unexpected good fortune to meet someone i have admired for many years : the @entity52 president and @entity54 winner @entity53 . i had the opportunity to chat with her , and the conversation left me even more impressed with her . she 's a truly inspiring woman . i tweeted a picture of the president and me , calling her " my hero , " a word i seldom use . moments later , i received a reply ( since deleted ) from a @entity66 connection informing me that @entity53 has a dismal record on gay rights and had very publicly announced she would refuse to sign a bill to end prison sentences for gay @entity52 . the incident reminded me of what has happened with another woman i have admired greatly over the years , the @entity75 pro-democracy leader @entity74 , also a @entity54 winner . @entity74 endured decades of house arrest and great personal hardship to help gain freedom for her people from a harsh military dictatorship that entrenched itself for half a century . it seemed a hopeless quest , but she persisted courageously . then , four years ago , the situation changed . the government of @entity75 ( also known as @entity75 ) freed her from arrest and she became a member of parliament and an influential political leader . the woman who stood firm for her principles has suddenly gone silent on one of the worst abuses still occurring in her country : the brutal treatment of @entity75 's @entity96 minority . this disappointed many of her admirers . like @entity53 on @entity101 issues , @entity74 is making cold political calculations on the issue of the @entity96 , weighing cost against benefit , and setting aside principles in the process . does that mean we should ignore these women 's incredible track records ? should we ignore the fact that @entity53 became the first woman to be democratically elected president in all of @entity115 , taking over a country racked by a brutal civil war and guiding it toward a better future ; inspiring @entity115 to fight against corruption , showing women everywhere that they can make a difference ? should we ignore @entity74 's astonishing ability to draw international attention to a repressive regime , paying an enormous personal price and ultimately succeeding ? or should we ignore their deliberate blind spots on politically inconvenient issues , even if they concern human rights , which were supposed to stand at the core of what drove these leaders ? the challenge is for each of us to make judgments based on our own values . consider @entity137 , the man who composed one of the most remarkable documents in human history -- the @entity141 . the words -- " we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal " -- are profound and history - changing . and yet , @entity137 , we now know , had a dark side , one that included not only slave ownership , but also the mistreatment of human beings he bought and sold . human flaws come in all sizes , some small , some overwhelming . men who have achieved the status of near saints were known as deeply flawed by those closest to them . @entity157 and @entity158 were terrible fathers . @entity160 , the man who gave us our beloved iphones and @entity163 , who made technology an irresistible , magnificent addition to our lives , turns out to have been a jerk in some ways . he was a genius , but he was , as one reviewer of his biography put it , " a world class asshole . " sports stars have broken the hearts of their admirers . from @entity178 and all those who took performance - enhancing drugs to the athletes who abuse their spouses , the sound of heroes crashing off the pedestals has been deafening . and we can be sure there are many more peccadilloes that would be found if the lens closed in tightly enough . the fact is , there are no perfect human beings . the ancient @entity192 took it even further , giving their gods deep , even devastating human - like shortcomings . they still had their strengths , but their weaknesses could compel their decision - making , taking them in disastrous directions . when mere mortals like the rest of us try to decide who is deserving of hero worship , we should temper our expectations . humans will disappoint . the truth is i am almost allergic to hero worship ( despite that recent tweet . ) there are people i admire , but i think it 's best to focus on the qualities of individuals when i find them to be inspiring and worthy of admiration -- whether it 's a girl from @entity218 or a particularly courageous and wise public figure . i try to appreciate moments of heroism and impressive personality traits . there are talented , courageous , inspiring politicians , actors , activists , artists and writers . but when it comes to all - around superheroes , they belong in the comic pages and the movies .

leaders like @placeholder and @entity74 are admirable , but not perfect
