( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 returned to @entity3 's starting line - up but he was only able to help the @entity5 side claim a point as they were held to a goalless draw by @entity8 on tuesday . @entity3 struggled to break down a resilient @entity8 defence and rarely tested home goalkeeper @entity10 as both sides opted for a solitary striker up front at @entity14 with chances at a premium . @entity1 , who had returned earlier than expected from a hamstring problem , was clearly short of match fitness and the @entity20 captain was unable to have his usual influence on the game . @entity24 winger @entity23 had the best opportunity for the visitors when he lashed a speculative lob from distance which appeared to be creeping under the bar before @entity31 goalkeeper @entity10 produced a one - handed save to push the ball over . despite the result @entity3 manager @entity33 remained upbeat and was pleased with @entity1 's return to match action . " it was positive for us to have @entity1 back -- you could see he still needs to improve his match fitness but it was not a risk to play him tonight , " @entity33 told @entity37 . " overall the final pass seemed to be difficult for us and @entity8 defended well . you can see the team was working hard and there are a lot of good things for us to take out of the game . " @entity3 are now unbeaten in five @entity5 clashes but are three points behind fourth - placed @entity53 , who eased to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity56 at @entity57 , in the race for the @entity60 places . spurs were searching for a first @entity5 this year and took the lead when @entity63 took advantage of some uncertainty in the @entity56 defence to clip the ball home from close range in the 27th minute . @entity71 's team were able to double that lead in the 60th minute when @entity73 made the most of a rare start when his free - kick was deflected past @entity56 goalkeeper @entity77 . elsewhere , @entity79 manager @entity78 was given a hostile reception at former club @entity81 but came away with a 1 - 0 win thanks to @entity84 's 35th minute strike which rattled in off the underside of the crossbar . @entity87 and @entity88 remain among the league 's strugglers after they played out a scrappy 1 - 1 draw at @entity92 . @entity88 took the lead when @entity95 's headed clearance looped in off the chest of @entity97 in the 52nd minute before @entity98 rescued a point for @entity87 in the 76th minute when he slotted the ball through the legs of @entity88 goalkeeper @entity102 . meanwhile @entity104 midfielder @entity103 scored the only goal of the game to give his side a narrow victory over nine - man @entity109 in the quarterfinal of the in the @entity111 . @entity109 goalkeeper @entity112 made a string of brilliant saves before @entity115 international @entity103 broke the deadlock at the @entity117 in the 74th minute @entity118 cushioned the ball into the path of @entity103 who drilled it in the bottom corner with a smart left - foot finish as @entity124 and @entity125 were sent off for the visitors .

@entity1 returned to @placeholder 's starting line - up but his side were held to a goalless draw with @entity8 on tuesday .
