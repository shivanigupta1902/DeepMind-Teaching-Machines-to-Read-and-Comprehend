( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has drawn a line under his row with @entity5 teammate @entity4 , saying it is time to " move forward . " their battle was one of the main talking points of sunday 's @entity11 , which ended in a runaway victory for triple world champion @entity13 . much of the race interest centered on the fight for minor placings , as @entity4 shunted through the field to take sixth -- his best position since joining from @entity19 after last season . @entity1 , the 2009 world champion , was back in 10th -- and complained bitterly after the race about @entity4 's aggressive tactics , with his car being hit by the @entity24 's on more than one occasion . " i 've raced with many team - mates over the years , and i had quite an aggressive teammate in @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , " @entity1 said . " but i 'm not used to driving along a straight and having a teammate coming alongside and banging wheels at 300 kilometers an hour . that is dangerous . " i 've had some tough fights in @entity35 , but not quite as dirty as that , so he has to calm down otherwise something serious will happen soon . " @entity4 admitted in the post-race conference it had been " a bit too risky . " " banging wheels was a bit too much , " the 23 - year - old said . " but he was as aggressive as i was as i went off the track a few times . " @entity4 had been told by team principal @entity46 to be more aggressive after just one top - 10 placing in his first three races -- finishing ninth in @entity49 . @entity1 took his boss to task about that during a television interview in the paddock at @entity55 , but on monday softened his stance . " important chat yesterday with @ @entity59 clear the air , " he wrote on @entity57 . " as a team we will move forward and live 2 fight another day ; ) roll on @entity65 . " @entity46 hailed the " maturity " of the 33 - year - old , and admitted he had resisted calls to stop the duo competing against each other . " i had a lot of noise in my ear , people saying ' stop this , stop this , it 's hurting us , ' suggesting i stop them racing , " he told the @entity72 @entity71 . " i did n't , and i know it could have gone horribly wrong . on balance it was the right thing -- in the long term -- for both drivers to know they are racing each other and are competitive . " the great thing about @entity1 is he 's a grown - up , he 'll get over it , and they 'll have a great relationship . " he has a balanced , mature approach . he knows his teammate has been under the hammer , is young , has had a bit of pressure , has something to learn and a point to prove . " @entity46 's approach is in stark contrast to that of other teams on the grid , with both @entity105 and @entity106 having issued driver orders during the season 's second race in @entity49 . @entity13 ignored instructions and overtook teammate @entity111 before claiming victory , but @entity106 ' @entity113 obeyed when told to stay behind @entity29 despite seemingly being quicker .
