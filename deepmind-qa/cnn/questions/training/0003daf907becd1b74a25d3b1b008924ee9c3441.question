( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's prime minister @entity1 on tuesday refused to apologize over damaging allegations that @entity2 's intelligence services spied on @entity6 's president @entity5 , tapping his personal mobile phone and those of his inner circle . " @entity2 should not be expected to apologize for the steps we take to protect our country now , or in the past , any more than other governments should be expected to apologize for the similar steps they have taken , " @entity1 said in an address to parliament . " importantly , in @entity2 's case , we use all our resources including information to help our friends and allies , not to harm them , " @entity1 said , adding that @entity2 should not be expected to detail what it does to protect its country any more than other countries do . " i want to make it absolutely crystal clear , @entity2 has deep respect for @entity6 , for its government , and for its people , " he said . " i regard president @entity5 as a good friend of @entity2 , indeed as one of the very best friends that we have anywhere in the world , that 's why ... i sincerely regret any embarrassment that recent media reports have caused him . " he said that it was in everyone 's interest that " cool heads prevail " over the spying scandal that has engulfed his new @entity48 government . on monday , the @entity50 government took what it described as " the serious step " of withdrawing its ambassador from the @entity2 capital @entity55 . @entity56 also summoned @entity2 ambassador @entity57 to voice its anger at allegations that @entity2 had been spying directly on the @entity50 president . earlier on tuesday , president @entity5 released a series of angry @entity62 -- translated from @entity6 into @entity63 and signed " @entity5 " to indicate they come straight from the president -- in which he attacked @entity1 over a perceived lack of remorse over the revelations . " i also regret the statement of ( the ) @entity2 prime minister that belittled this tapping matter in @entity6 without any remorse . * @entity5 * , " the tweet read . " these @entity76 & @entity2 actions have certainly damaged the strategic partnership with @entity6 , as fellow democracies . * @entity5 * , " an earlier tweet read . @entity6 earlier this month expressed outrage over reports that @entity2 's @entity56 embassy was used as part of a @entity76 - led spying network in @entity86 . in his series of tweets , @entity5 called on the @entity2 government to " give us an official answer which can be understood by broader @entity50 society about the tapping . " while the direct attack on @entity1 is likely to be a blow for the new @entity48 government , which has made much of maintaining good relations with its populous northern neighbor -- a key ally and trading partner -- @entity1 has been consistently unrepentant about the revelations . speaking in parliament on monday , @entity1 had said : " the @entity2 government never comments on specific intelligence matters . " all governments gather information and all governments know that every other government gathers information . " i will never say or do anything that might damage the strong relationship and the close co-operation that we have with @entity6 , which is all in all our most important relationship . " @entity6 's objections stem from reports in the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) and @entity117 that said @entity2 intelligence tracked @entity5 's mobile phone for 15 days in august 2009 , monitoring the calls he made and received . the intelligence agency also tried to listen in on what was said on at least one occasion . but the call was less than a minute long and could not be successfully tapped , @entity116 reported . the two media outlets cited documents provided by @entity127 , the @entity76 national security contractor - turned - leaker .
