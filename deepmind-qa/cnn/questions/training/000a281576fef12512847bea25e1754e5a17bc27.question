editors note : @entity2 human trafficking fellow @entity1 is undertaking a research trip around @entity4 , looking at issues of forced labor , trafficking and child bondage . he will be getting access to the heart of the problem , and telling @entity12 readers what he has discovered every week over the next ten weeks . this is his first submission . @entity15 , @entity16 -- after a long journey from @entity19 , i have been in @entity15 for several days now easing into a full ten weeks that i will spend researching child labor , bonded labor , and human trafficking throughout @entity4 . it is not the best time of year to be trudging through the rural reaches of the region , but as @entity16 love to say , " what to do ? " at least the monsoons have arrived and temperatures have dropped a few degrees -- though the air is so moist it is hard to tell the difference between rainfall and humidity ! it is hard to imagine that i first started my research into human trafficking and modern slavery more than ten years ago . while i had little idea what i was doing then , i have a far more efficient rhythm to my research now . i have taken eight research trips of greater than one month during the last decade , and many more quick hits here and there gathering data and learning how and why human trafficking and forced labor take place around the world . of course , slave exploitation takes place everywhere -- in the middle of major cities and in the deepest rural reaches of the globe . i have seen more than my share of human cruelty -- from forced prostitution of minors to organ harvesting and everything in between . at the other end of the spectrum , i intend to explore child labor in fishing industries in parts of @entity4 that require two day hikes to reach , but that does not stop the shrimp from ending up at your cocktail parties . overall , this research trip is the first of three that i will take across the next twelve months , covering @entity4 , @entity74 , and @entity75 , with short jaunts to @entity77 and @entity78 , all of which will allow me to complete my next two books on human trafficking and modern slavery . i am excited to contribute this blog to @entity12 during this first trip , and i hope it proves interesting to those who read it . in a way , we will be undertaking this trip together , as i share my latest learning 's , triumphs , and frustrations each week . we will search out slave labor hand - in - hand , and we will interview those who have suffered intense cruelty in a region of the world that is home to more slaves than any other on @entity102 . there is much i am proud of as a man of @entity16 descent , but some have argued that @entity16 's record on protecting the weak , poor , and downtrodden is far from pride - worthy . i hope my approach to the issue of forced labor -- predicated on documenting the human pain of this exploitation while also understanding the business and economic forces that drive it -- will lead us to a more effective response . as i commence this trip in an extraordinary nation that simultaneously invokes the deepest love and frustration in me , i am reminded of the words of @entity16 's first prime minister , @entity123 , uttered in the nascent moments of freedom from the @entity126 : " the future beckons to us ... to bring freedom and opportunity to the common man , to the peasants and workers of @entity16 ; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease ... and to create social , economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman . " this is the future that beckoned all of @entity4 more than sixty years ago , on those first days of freedom from tyranny and exploitation . yet this promise remains deeply elusive for hundreds of millions of poor who scrape by on one dollar per day in income , and even more so for the millions of slaves in this region , who remain oppressed by tyranny and bondage , praying each night to break free of exploitation and achieve the " fullness of life , " that is their human birthright .

@entity1 begins 10 week journey into @placeholder .
