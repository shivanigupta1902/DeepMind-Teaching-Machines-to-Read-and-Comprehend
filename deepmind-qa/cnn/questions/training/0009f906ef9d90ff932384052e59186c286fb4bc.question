( @entity0 ) -- children play with a worn - out badminton set . families sip traditional @entity5 tea known as chai from silver - colored cups and chat as the sun sets in a rose - colored sky . goats bleat in the distance , water buffaloes chew on hay and the cackles of crows ring through the air . welcome to the village of @entity18 , in southeast @entity5 , not far from the @entity19 . here , lush green rice paddies ring concrete homes in various stages of construction . i came here with 15 colleagues to help these villagers , who are among some of @entity5 's poorest and most disadvantaged people . we came to help build safe and solid concrete and brick homes for them . the villagers are @entity36 -- once known as untouchables -- and they still suffer from discrimination . this group of 90 families live in thatched - roof huts that are prone to leaks and have mud floors that wash away . some of their children attend a " school " that is a small outdoor space in front of a church . many only have the clothes on their backs for daily wear . @entity53 , head of the @entity54 ( which partners with @entity56 nongovernmental organization @entity55 , the group we used to volunteer in @entity5 ) and our leader on this project , told us that giving the villagers these homes would not only physically improve their lives but it would also boost their morale -- endowing them with a new sense of pride and helping them to dream of a brighter future . despite their tough lives -- many of the village men can only get work a few months a year on the rice paddies -- the villagers were enthusiastic , generous and hard - working . we worked under humid skies and sunny days , sometimes in more than 40 - degree @entity79 ( 104 degrees @entity80 ) temperatures . we carted cement , sifted materials , mixed cement , plastered walls -- and one day we worked together as a group to plaster a roof . it was back - breaking work , and watching the villagers tirelessly do it inspired me to do as much as i physically could , though we had to drink copious amounts of water and eat a lot of food . i became known as the " after lunch napper , " frazzled by the morning 's duties . as we worked side by side with the villagers , we got to know them and their friends . one family i spent a lot of time with was building their home to accommodate four generations : their parents , their children and their grandchild . their names were @entity114 ( the grandfather ) , his son - in - law @entity116 and his daughter , @entity117 . @entity116 and @entity117 's eldest daughter had polio , which led to her legs being amputated . the couple help raise their daughter 's grandchild , a 5 - year - old boy named @entity125 , who has a clever smile and always seemed ready to test the commands of his grandparents . i visited them in their hut , where they lived in a space that seemed to measure about 10 feet by 10 feet . i knew the new home -- at a cost of just $ 1,500 -- would dramatically change their lives . despite the difficulty of their situation , they kept telling our project leader @entity53 that i was working too hard and needed to rest . they always brought us superb chai tea to drink with them . but all i wanted was to help them and all the others as much as possible while we were there to get the house done . i think we did a good job : though the homes were unfinished when we left after two weeks of work , noticeable progress had been made . most importantly , we felt the townspeople 's spirits were lifted . during our time , we met many families and played games with the children . we asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up . one of my colleagues brought bubbles ( which were very popular ) , while others brought clothes , pens and pencils , and sports equipment . @entity53 said the villagers benefited by meeting people from outside their world , getting to speak @entity173 and exchange ideas . but the benefits were definitely mutual : we got to learn about them , too , their lives , goals and interests . these villagers have so many needs : proper schooling , health care , hygiene , clothing , mosquito nets ( which only cost $ 5 ) and , of course , housing . but i saw that given the right tools and opportunity , the people of @entity18 were quite capable of accomplishing what they set out to do . on our last night , the villagers threw us a party and we danced together in the new saris and kurtas they had given us . we all left wondering what we could do next to help them and discussed plans for future work in @entity18 .
