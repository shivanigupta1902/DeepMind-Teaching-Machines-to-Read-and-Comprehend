( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has cast doubts on the hopes of several countries bidding to host the 2018 and @entity6 tournaments in a technical evaluation report released by soccer 's governing body on wednesday . @entity14 , seeking to host football 's premier event for the first time in 2018 , was criticized for its limited transport options -- which may cause problems due to " the country 's vastness and remoteness ' " the report said . its information and communications technology needs to be upgraded , while 13 of its proposed 16 stadiums will be started from scratch and its accommodation plan suggests " a dependence on construction and modernization in the hotel sector . " @entity14 received a " low risk " legal rating , as did its main @entity32 rivals @entity31 and @entity34 - @entity33 , but the @entity37 - @entity36 joint bid was marked " medium risk " . @entity31 , the 1966 host , received a mainly favorable evaluation but it failed to meet @entity1 's requirements for venue - specific training sites and accommodation . the @entity34 - @entity33 bid also fell short in required contracted venue - specific training sites , but it has an advantage over @entity31 in that there are no government restrictions on media rights . the @entity37 - @entity36 bid fell short in team facility and accommodation requirements , and did not supply the necessary government guarantees to satisfy @entity1 's protection program needs . of the 2022 candidates , @entity56 's bid was highlighted as having the most shortfalls -- mainly due to the small size of the country , its excessively hot climate during the tournament months of june - july , and the need to start most construction from scratch . " the fact that 10 out of the 12 stadiums are located within a 25 - 30 kilometer radius could represent an operational and logistical challenge , " the report said . " any delay in the completion of the transport projects could impact @entity1 's tournament operations . moreover , it appears to be difficult to test a transport concept prior to the event under conditions comparable to the @entity6 . " the fact that the competition is planned in june - july , the two hottest months of the year in this region , has to be considered as a potential health risk for players , officials , the @entity1 family and spectators , and requires precautions to be taken . " the @entity56 bid was praised for a novel aspect to its stadium plans , which would see modular sections used to build 22 grounds around the world in developing countries . its time - zone difference of three hours from @entity32 means it rated higher in terms of television revenue -- an area where rivals @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 fell down . @entity101 's geographical size was also highlighted as a potential problem , while it failed to meet @entity1 's accommodation requirements , but it was rated a low legal risk . the @entity109 ' size was not deemed to be problematic given the competitiveness of its air industry , but the report noted temporary transport would have to be provided to and from most of the proposed stadiums . the @entity109 government did not provide the necessary guarantee , but @entity1 said the country 's past experience in hosting major sports events -- including the 1994 @entity6 -- had proved its willingness to make material concessions " and " accommodate the concerns of event organizers . " the @entity109 bid had the highest projected tickets sold of almost five million , and the report said " tv ratings and media rights in the @entity130 are likely to be higher . " @entity103 and @entity102 are seeking to stage the event for the second time , having been co-hosts in 2002 . @entity103 's bid focused on innovative high - tech aspects , and was praised for its facilities and transport , though its government did not provide the required guarantees and it was rated a medium legal risk . @entity102 , which hopes to stage some games in the @entity142 , met most requirements but received one black mark in that " the majority of @entity1 's constituent target groups would be accommodated in two or three - star quality standard rooms . " it was given a low legal risk rating , but @entity1 said its broadcasting law " adversely affects the free and unrestricted exploitation of media rights " and therefore needs to be suspended . @entity1 's executive committee members , who have been lobbied by all the candidates and visited their facilities , will vote to decide the hosts for both tournaments on december 2 . other factors apart from the technical requirements have historically played a part in awarding hosting rights . @entity1 took the 2010 tournament to @entity163 despite a lack of existing infrastructure in a bid to develop football on the continent , having done the same in the @entity109 in 1994 . meanwhile , @entity1 's ethics committee will announce on thursday the fate of the two executive committee members accused of offering to sell their @entity6 votes , the @entity171 @entity170 reported on wednesday . @entity177 's @entity176 and @entity179 president @entity178 were last month provisionally suspended along with four other @entity1 officials following an undercover investigation by @entity171 newspaper the @entity183 . the ethics committee also investigated claims of illegal collusion between bid candidates at its three - day hearing in @entity189 this week .

@entity14 , @placeholder and @entity109 may have problems due to geographical " vastness "
