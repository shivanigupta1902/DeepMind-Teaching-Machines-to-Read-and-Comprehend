@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- army maj. @entity3 challenged a witness 's account of the police shootout that ended a rampage at @entity0 that left 13 people dead , a rare courtroom exchange from a man who has admitted to opening fire on soldiers deploying to @entity13 and @entity14 . the exchange occurred after prosecution witness sgt. @entity16 testified to seeing @entity3 shoot a police officer and then shoot her again while she was down . @entity3 is acting as his own attorney , defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the november 5 , 2009 , attack . " i do n't want to put words in your mouth . are you saying that she was disarmed and that i continued to fire at her ? " @entity3 asked . @entity16 responded : " yes . " " i have no more questions , " @entity3 said . for his part , @entity3 has said little during the death penalty trial , other than to say he was the shooter . but on monday , @entity3 appeared to be casting doubt on @entity16 's testimony that he shot a wounded , unarmed female police officer . the officer earlier testified that after @entity3 shot her , he kicked her weapon out of her reach . @entity3 has left no doubt about his role , telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement : " the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter . " he 's also left little question about why he did it , repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect @entity49 leaders in @entity13 from the @entity51 military . fast facts : soldier on soldier attacks while the military has avoided labeling @entity3 a terrorist or charging him as such , prosecutors wanted to use the evidence to show that the devout @entity60 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings . @entity3 , who was scheduled to deploy to @entity13 , did not want to fight against other @entity60 and believed " that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " lead prosecutor col. @entity68 has said . the judge , col. @entity69 , excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack , including e-mail communications between @entity3 and @entity75 , the @entity51 - born cleric who officials say became a key member of @entity78 . he was killed in @entity51 drone strike in 2011 . @entity69 ruled that the e-mails would have to be " redacted to prevent undue prejudice by association " and would diminish its use as evidence . she also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain show maj. @entity3 's interest in the actions of @entity90 sgt. @entity89 , the @entity51 soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the @entity14 war -- an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing @entity60 . " the court believes sgt. @entity89 is not on trial in this case , " @entity69 said . " it would only open the door to a mini-trial " and confuse the issue . @entity0 victims feel betrayed along with the e-mails and the material related to @entity89 , @entity69 also declined to allow the use of @entity3 's academic presentation on suicide bombings , saying " motive is not an element of the crime . " the judge did allow prosecutors to use evidence of @entity3 's internet searches on jihad and the @entity49 in the days and hours before the attack . just two hours before the shooting , a search of @entity3 's @entity124 netbook computer showed that someone had pulled up and read an article entitled " @entity129 @entity49 chief urges @entity49 to fight @entity90 , " @entity121 special agent @entity120 , a computer forensics examiner , testified . with the prosecution expected to rest as early as tuesday , the big question is whether @entity3 will take the stand . @entity3 , 42 , has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand . if he testifies , @entity3 is expected to discuss the religious justification for his actions . much has been made about @entity3 's defense or , as his stand - by attorneys have said , the lack of it , indicating he is perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence . @entity3 refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court - martial after the judge barred him from pleading guilty . under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases . the judge on monday raised again concerns about @entity3 acting as his own attorney after he admitted last week he did not understand that by listing someone as a witness he gave up the right of privileged communication with that person . " remember when i told you that i thought you would be better off with a trained lawyer ? " @entity69 asked . @entity3 responded : " repeatedly . " " i 've advised you before and i 'm advising you again that it 's not a good policy to represent yourself . ... do you understand that ? " @entity69 said . @entity3 said : " yes , i do . " military death row : more than 50 years and no executions last week , @entity3 released a portion of his mental health evaluation to the @entity168 . it revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr . " i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life . however , if i died by lethal injection i would still be a martyr , " @entity3 told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial , according to documents published by the @entity168 . @entity3 has been using a wheelchair since being shot by @entity0 police . he is paralyzed from the chest down . a @entity51 - born citizen of @entity184 descent , @entity3 was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the @entity90 in 1997 . but he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military , saying he had been taunted by people after the september 11 terror attacks that year . in 2006 , he inquired about the possibility of filing conscientious objector status . he did not go through with it , and the judge ruled that his inquiry could not be used by prosecutors to show motive .
