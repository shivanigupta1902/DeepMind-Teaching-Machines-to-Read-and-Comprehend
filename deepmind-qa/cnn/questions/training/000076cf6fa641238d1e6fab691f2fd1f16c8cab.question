@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- a bill that places new restrictions on abortion passed the @entity6 on friday after days of debate that galvanized activists nationwide . it was the second attempt by the measure 's supporters to pass the bill in the @entity6 -- it originally failed to gain approval because of a filibuster by @entity16 sen. @entity15 . the @entity6 voted 19 to 11 to approve the restrictions . @entity18 gov. @entity17 , who supports the new abortion laws , called the state legislature back into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill , which passed the @entity23 on wednesday . the measure bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation , mandates abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers , tightens usage guidelines for the drug @entity30 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing such services . opinion : it 's the real @entity41 who count critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in @entity0 -- denying access to many in rural communities -- and force women to seek dangerous back - alley abortions . the @entity18 legislators who support it say the bill is n't about banning abortions , but rather about protecting women 's health . the special session was marked by loud protests and high - profile voices from both sides of the abortion debate . taking a swipe at former @entity63 sen. @entity63 , who came to @entity1 to support the bill , @entity16 sen. @entity61 made a final appeal to the @entity18 to vote no , asking them to : " take this chance to stop , take this chance to think , take this chance to stop listening to the partisans and failed presidential candidates . " cowboy @entity17 will ride again - in 2016 however , for supporters of the bill such as sen. @entity75 , the bill 's measures are long overdue . " there is a clear choice in this vote tonight , " she said . " do we keep the lax standards , do we forgo safeguards , do we ignore the evidence that at 20 weeks we have a child who can feel ? or do we choose life ? " the roars of the crowd in the rotunda were audible throughout the @entity6 debate and at one point , abortion rights protesters disrupted the proceedings in the @entity6 gallery . one protester , singing quietly to the chamber , chained herself to a railing in the gallery and brought the session to a brief halt . the bill makes its way to @entity17 , who will sign it into law . " today the @entity105 took its final step in our historic effort to protect life , " @entity17 said after the bill 's passage . " this legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women 's health . i am proud of our lawmakers and citizens who tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable @entity41 and future @entity117 . " @entity118 , a leading reproductive health provider , decried the passage and called on voters to throw out the politicians who voted for it . " if you are angry about what happened in @entity0 tonight -- and what 's happening in other states all around the country -- there is something you can do about it , " spokeswoman @entity124 said . " @entity132 to vote , and vote for candidates who will protect women 's access to health care .
