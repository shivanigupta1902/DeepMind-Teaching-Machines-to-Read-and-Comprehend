editor 's note : @entity2 served as chief counsel to sens. @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 and special counsel for president @entity8 . he now works as a pro bono private counsel on civil rights and human rights issues . former @entity4 aide @entity2 says the senator had a zest for politics and an appetite for hard work . ( @entity17 ) -- for half a century , @entity4 was the most prolific senator on the political scene , making major strides in civil rights , civil liberties , education , human rights abroad , arms control , good government and of course health care . you name it , he was there -- and in the lead . to some tabloid readers , he was largely a spoiled @entity32 playboy . to his colleagues and staff who watched him up close year after year , and to millions of @entity35 who saw him fighting on so many fronts , he was a committed champion of equality , justice , peace and protection of those in need . how did he do it ? with incredibly long hours , amazing energy and hard work , coupled with a zest for politics -- in the best sense -- and legendary legislative mastery acquired over the years . his staff knew that when he was starting an initiative , his first priority instinctively was to win over as staunch a conservative as he could find to be his partner and original co-sponsor . it worked so many times . sometimes , he would leave an evening event where he was the honoree before it had ended . the next day , a cynical scribe might note that shortly after receiving his award , " @entity4 bugged out early . " i knew that the senator had gone home to be able to help his son with homework or put him to bed , and then had begun a late - night briefing with staff to prepare for an important hearing the next morning . finally , over a life of personal trials and tribulations , @entity4 had developed great " empathy " -- a word recently much maligned , but all - important in the @entity75 's staid , marble halls . he had endured the physical and emotional pain that enabled him to feel the pain of illness , discrimination or disability endured by others . you could see that he did , as he gently helped a tearful witness through difficult testimony at a @entity75 hearing . @entity4 knew well that on @entity87 you tried for a full loaf , sometimes took half of one and , if necessary , you planted the flag , took a slice and came back another day for more . but he also remembered @entity94 's admonition : " @entity95 , toujours l'audace ( boldness , always boldness . ) " the @entity98 , the crown jewel of modern civil rights laws , revolutionized @entity35 . in small @entity103 towns and elsewhere in the @entity104 where @entity105 - @entity35 once feared walking past the sheriff 's office , they now may be the elected sheriff , mayor or state senator . the same is true for @entity110 in parts of the @entity112 . the act 's two main parts are @entity115 . section 2 is a permanent , nationwide prohibition against electoral discrimination . section 5 requires preclearance by the @entity35 attorney general of election law changes in jurisdictions covered by the provision . from the beginning , @entity119 was controversial and was set to expire in 1982 . in 1980 , however , a @entity127 ruling had gutted the equally important section 2 with a statutory misinterpretation . @entity4 had to decide which section to save . the nation 's civil rights coalition urged him to go for both . many @entity134 warned that trying to preserve both was a bridge too far and that @entity4 would risk losing everything . after much debate , and uncertainty , he firmly decided to go for broke , and " ran the table . " section 5 was preserved for another 25 years , while the statutory clarification of section 2 , combined with the 1990 census , dramatically increased the number of minority members of @entity147 . @entity4 was interested in results . at the outset of @entity151 , long before it became a constant headline , he and his staff started the @entity75 investigations , fully apace with the @entity154 , and unearthed the " dirty tricks project " of the @entity156 . but he came to realize that a @entity4 was not the most appropriate person to chair hearings on the @entity159 and supported majority leader @entity161 's creation of the select " @entity162 " to finish the job . @entity4 's intense pursuit of the causes he championed was matched by his fabled sense of humor . i enjoyed both his huge store of anecdotes and his gentle barbs , except when i was the target . sitting in the back of the @entity75 chamber behind him and sens. @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity5 while they regaled each other with the foibles of @entity180 was a treat that helped lighten the often tense atmosphere of debate on heated issues . occasionally , he missed the humor in the situation , especially if advance work for his events was n't up to his standards . i remember @entity4 rebuking @entity191 , his speechwriter , and me for running late as he weaved through traffic from his suburban home to an interview by civil rights leader and radio host @entity197 . @entity191 kept assuring him that the interview would be prerecorded and could be taped whenever they got there . then , at a stoplight , a cabbie leaned out his window and yelled : " hey @entity4 , you 're late . they 're all waiting for you . " it turned out that , because @entity4 had been in the news a lot , @entity207 had decided to do the interview live on his daily show . needless to say , @entity4 did not laugh . superseding these and many other recollections of @entity4 the senator is my vivid memory of him as a person uniquely able to distract and comfort others in distress . on time stands out . when my first @entity75 boss , @entity5 , was in the last stages of his battle with cancer , @entity4 spent hours by his side offering humor , @entity227 tales and @entity75 banter almost endlessly , as @entity229 and many others have now done for him . hopefully , we will see his like again . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .

he says @entity4 's adroit work saved the @placeholder
