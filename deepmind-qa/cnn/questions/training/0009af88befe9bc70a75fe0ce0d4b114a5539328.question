( @entity0 ) -- the suspect charged with murder in last week 's shooting that left one person dead and two wounded at @entity7 wrote a journal entry on the morning of the shooting stating " i just want people to die , and i 'm going to die with them , " prosecutors said . in the weeks before the shooting , @entity15 , 26 , kept a journal in which he allegedly expressed " admiration for the perpetrators of other incidents of mass violence -- at @entity22 and at @entity23 , " @entity14 prosecuting attorney @entity13 said . @entity13 said the entries also indicate @entity15 had considered shooting people at other campuses in @entity27 but chose @entity7 shortly before the incident . he was n't a student at the school . @entity15 is charged with one count of murder in the first degree and two counts of attempted murder in the first degree , prosecutors announced tuesday . prosecutors will seek a special sentence of life in prison , @entity13 said . @entity15 typically would face 69 to 86 years in prison if convicted of the charges , but prosecutors will argue that an aggravating factor -- a " destructive and foreseeable impact on persons beyond the victims " -- allows for a life sentence . @entity15 is scheduled to be arraigned june 23 , @entity13 said . counselors and friendly friends even showed @entity15 around the campus in the days before the shooting , and he allegedly carried out the minute - long shooting just before the academic year ended , @entity13 said . @entity15 allegedly kept the journal in anticipation that he would die in the attack , the prosecutor said . @entity15 allegedly went to the campus armed with a 12 - caliber double - barrel shotgun with 50 rounds in his pockets . but the gun malfunctioned , rendering the double - barrel shotgun into a single - barrel one , the prosecutor said . @entity15 allegedly fired only two shots -- killing one student and wounding two others -- before student security guard @entity69 pepper - sprayed @entity15 's eyes and took away the shotgun , @entity13 said . @entity69 put the shotgun in his office and returned to take a large hunting knife away from @entity15 , @entity13 alleged . another student assisted in allegedly disarming @entity15 , kicking the knife out of reach , @entity13 said . " @entity69 is an authentic hero , " @entity13 said . " he saved many more lives . " during the shooting , one student was wearing headphones and was oblivious to the noise and the fact that a shotgun was pointed at him , @entity13 said . the gunman decided not to shoot the students , @entity13 said . " just as suddenly as this crime erupted , it was over , " @entity13 said . " the whole thing took less than a minute . " @entity15 is accused of fatally shooting @entity90 , a 19 - year - old student , in the back of the head , @entity13 said . one of the wounded , a 19 - year - old woman , underwent surgery after the shooting , @entity93 of @entity94 said . a second victim , a 24 - year - old man , was discharged friday , she said . the shooting at the university on thursday afternoon began when a man armed with a shotgun opened fire outside and inside @entity105 , which houses the engineering , math and science departments . @entity15 has a history of mental health problems and was on suicide watch last week at the jail , public defender @entity109 said . @entity15 has " significant and long - standing mental health issues , including delusions that were in play " at the time of the shooting , she told reporters last week . " ... he 's on suicide watch for a reason . he did not think he was going to survive yesterday . he intended to die . " @entity109 said @entity15 was aware of what happened . " he is cognizant of the suffering of the victims and their families and the entire @entity126 , " she said . " he is sorry . " @entity15 had had several run - ins with police in recent years . he was taken into custody in 2010 and 2012 for a mental health hold , @entity130 assistant police chief @entity129 told @entity0 . in both cases , authorities determined @entity15 was intoxicated , incoherent and suicidal , @entity129 said . the image of the suspect as a gun - toting killer is a difficult one to reconcile for those who know him . one friend described @entity15 as " socially awkward " but " appreciative , " according to @entity141 . " i have no idea what set him off , " said @entity142 . " that 's why this whole thing kind of surprises me -- that he was trying to turn his life around , that he was trying to be a better person , and he was kind of working on his social skills , too . " @entity0 's @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .
