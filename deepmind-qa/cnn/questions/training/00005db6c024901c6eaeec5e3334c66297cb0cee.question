former @entity1 captain @entity0 has announced his retirement from international football with immediate effect . the @entity6 defender , who won 78 - caps for his country , was scheduled to attend an @entity10 hearing on monday for allegedly racially abusing @entity12 's @entity11 . @entity0 was cleared of the allegations by a @entity15 court in july . @entity0 , who lost the armband on two separate occasions for off - field incidents , says the @entity10 has made his " position with the national team untenable " . and the 31 - year - old has now confirmed he will be unavailable to represent @entity1 in their quest to qualify for the @entity23 in @entity24 . in a statement , he said : " i am today announcing my retirement from international football . i would like to thank the @entity1 managers who have selected me for my 78 caps . " i have had great pleasure in sharing that honor with all the players that i 've played with . i would like to thank them , the fans and my family for their support and encouragement during my international career . " representing and captaining my country is what i dreamed of as a boy and it has been a truly great honor . i have always given my all and it breaks my heart to make this decision . " i want to wish @entity47 and the team every success for the future . " i am making this statement today in advance of the hearing of the @entity10 disciplinary charge because i feel the @entity10 , in pursuing charges against me where i have already been cleared in a court of law , have made my position with the national team untenable . " i now look forward to playing for @entity6 , and challenging for domestic and @entity61 honors , and i want to thank the fans and the club for their continued support . " @entity0 made his @entity1 debut in 2003 against @entity66 and @entity67 and was made permanent captain in 2008 . but his tenure as captain came to an ignominious end in february 2010 after he was revealed as the sportsman behind a gagging injunction involving his private life . a court order had previously been in place , covering an alleged relationship between married @entity0 and @entity79 model @entity78 -- a former partner of teammate @entity81 . @entity0 was restored as captain by @entity83 on march 19 2011 before losing the armband once again following the alleged incident with @entity11 during @entity6 's game at @entity12 last october . @entity0 's final game for @entity1 was earlier this month when he played in the 5 - 0 win over @entity89 in @entity90 .
