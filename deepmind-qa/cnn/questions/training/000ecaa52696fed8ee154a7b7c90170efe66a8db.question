( @entity0 ) -- sen. @entity1 decisively defeated sen. @entity2 in @entity3 tuesday , but @entity5 's narrow victory in @entity6 will likely send the race for the @entity9 presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries . sen. @entity1 and his wife , @entity12 , greet supporters in @entity14 , @entity3 . as polls closed in @entity6 , @entity5 had a double - digit lead over @entity1 , but by the end of the evening , @entity5 's lead had shrunk , dragging the race out until early wednesday . a clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from @entity22 , a @entity23 suburb in northwestern @entity6 with several precincts that went strongly for @entity1 . by wednesday morning , all absentee ballots had been counted in @entity22 and the final results showed @entity1 had taken the county by 12 percentage points . there were 115 delegates at stake in @entity3 and 72 in @entity6 . because @entity9 delegates are awarded proportionally , @entity1 added four delegates to his lead , according to @entity0 estimates . @entity1 earlier claimed a decisive victory in @entity3 . with 99 percent of precincts reporting , @entity1 held a 14 - point lead over @entity5 . watch analysis of @entity3 , in primaries » " some were saying that @entity3 would be a game - changer in this election . but today , what @entity3 decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in @entity47 , " @entity1 told supporters in @entity14 , @entity3 . watch @entity1 thank his supporters » @entity1 took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in @entity3 , according to exit polls , while @entity5 claimed only 6 percent . @entity5 took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for @entity1 , according to the polls . @entity5 told her supporters in @entity55 , " it 's full - speed on to the @entity57 . " watch @entity5 greet her supporters » @entity5 made a strong pitch to blue - collar workers in @entity6 . she pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban @entity6 during tuesday 's primary . in @entity0 exit polling , @entity5 took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas , compared with 47 percent for @entity1 of @entity67 . she took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with @entity1 's 32 percent . in all , 1,738 voters were polled . @entity5 had pitched herself as the candidate best - suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working - class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline . " i believe that @entity82 need a champion in their corners , " she said at a rally in @entity55 . " for too long we 've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well - connected , but i do n't think that 's what @entity82 need . " standing up for working people is about the @entity89 and about the @entity9 ; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together . " eighty - nine percent of @entity6 voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession . @entity5 had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to @entity1 's 47 percent . the candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 . according to early exit polls , half of @entity5 's supporters in @entity6 would not vote for @entity1 in a general election matchup with sen. @entity111 , the presumptive @entity112 presidential nominee . watch what the exit polls show » a third of @entity5 voters said they would pick @entity111 over @entity1 , while 17 percent said they would not vote at all . forty - eight percent of @entity5 supporters said they would back @entity1 in november . @entity1 got even less support from @entity5 backers in @entity3 , where 45 percent of @entity5 supporters said they would vote for him over @entity111 . thirty - eight percent of @entity5 supporters said they would vote for @entity111 while 12 percent said they would not vote . @entity1 voters appear to be more willing to support @entity5 in november . in @entity6 , 59 percent of @entity1 backers said they 'd vote for @entity5 , and 70 percent of @entity1 backers in @entity3 said vote for her against @entity111 . @entity1 on tuesday said he did n't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite . " tonight , many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that sen. @entity5 's supporters will not support me , and that my supporters will not support her , " he said . " i 'm here tonight to tell you that i do n't believe it . yes , there have been bruised feelings on both sides . yes , each side desperately wants their candidate to win . but ultimately , this race is not about @entity2 or @entity1 or @entity111 . " this election is about you -- the @entity82 people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future . " @entity1 currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won , and he is ahead in the popular vote , if @entity149 and @entity150 are not factored into the equation . those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules . with neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the @entity9 nomination by june 3 , the end of the primary season , the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates : @entity9 governors , members of @entity165 and party officials . watch how superdelegates could come into play » both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between @entity6 and @entity3 , each arguing to crucial working - class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign . @entity0 's @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .
