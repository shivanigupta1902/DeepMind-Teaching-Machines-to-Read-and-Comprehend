" it is a very emotional thing , " @entity103 said . " it is a big honor because in a way , this is about representing all the people who are hurt by @entity16 's policies . " the trial in absentia of the four @entity5 commanders highlights the lingering rupture in relations between @entity3 and @entity16 , two @entity118 countries that were once close military allies . @entity3 - @entity5 ties were already strained before the bloody night in may 2010 , when @entity5 commandos rappelled from hovering helicopters onto the deck of the @entity9 . since then , @entity3 has cut military ties and withdrawn its ambassador from @entity16 in protest . @entity127 is also demanding an apology and reparations for the eight @entity3 and one @entity3 - @entity131 citizen killed on board the @entity9 . @entity3 says the ship was in international waters when the commandos boarded it by force , killing the nine passengers . @entity16 says the organized resistance of armed passengers aboard the @entity9 justified the use of deadly force . @entity3 legal experts said since the four @entity5 defendants are being tried in absentia and since @entity5 does not appear to recognize the trial , the @entity146 is likely to assign @entity3 attorneys to represent the defendants . @entity1 's @entity149 in @entity0 and @entity150 in @entity151 contributed to this report .
