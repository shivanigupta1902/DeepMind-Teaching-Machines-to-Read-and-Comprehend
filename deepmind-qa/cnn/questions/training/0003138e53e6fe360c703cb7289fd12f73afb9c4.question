( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 continued their 100 per cent start to the @entity3 season with an impressive 2 - 0 win over @entity5 in @entity6 saturday . the heavyweight clash before a capacity crowd at the @entity9 was expected to be a testing encounter for @entity12 team , but two goals just short of the hour mark from @entity15 and @entity16 eased their passage . it left @entity1 on a maximum 12 points after four games , heading @entity21 , 2 - 1 winners at @entity22 , on goal difference . two - time defending champions @entity24 lost ground with a 3 - 2 defeat at @entity28 to leave them five points adrift of the leading pair . @entity1 had been the better side in the first half with the @entity33 of @entity5 unable to create a clear cut opening . @entity36 international pair @entity15 and @entity16 looked dangerous throughout and it was their combination that led to the 55th minute opener . @entity16 played in @entity39 to beat @entity40 with a low shot and three minutes later he was also on the score sheet with a fine individual goal . @entity16 might have scored a second with a clever back heel , but his team were already guaranteed three points to follow on from their impressive 2 - 1 champions @entity49 win over @entity51 in midweek . meanwhile , @entity24 's 31 - match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end at struggling @entity28 , who had been without a win . @entity58 's @entity57 scored twice for the home side , including the clinching third . @entity61 was also on target for the northerners while @entity65 's @entity64 twice equalized for @entity24 . @entity66 also secured their first win of the season as they beat @entity69 2 - 0 , while in other matches @entity70 and @entity71 were goalless and @entity74 's @entity73 drew 1 - 1 with promoted @entity75 .
