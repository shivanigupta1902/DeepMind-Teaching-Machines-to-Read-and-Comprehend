( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 and @entity2 held their highest level talks for more than six decades tuesday , marking the first government - to - government contact since the pair 's acrimonious split in 1949 . @entity8 of @entity1 's @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , which oversees the island 's @entity2 policy , met with his mainland @entity2 counterpart @entity12 , of @entity2 's @entity14 . after the meeting , @entity2 's state news agency @entity15 said the two sides had agreed to open a regular communication channel . " we should both be resolute to not let cross-strait relations suffer any more twists and turns , and never let it ( the relationship ) go backward , " @entity12 was quoted by @entity15 as saying . previous contact between the two sides has been conducted through semi-official foundations or through political parties , not by government ministers acting in their official capacities . " being able to sit down and talk today was quite unimaginable in the past , " @entity15 quoted @entity8 as saying . in a statement , @entity1 's @entity9 said that @entity8 had invited @entity12 to visit @entity1 to better understand society and popular sentiment . @entity1 president @entity31 said the visit had " extraordinary significance , " according to the island 's @entity33 . on his departure from @entity37 , @entity8 said the visit would not be " easy " and the two sides would not sign any specific agreement . the meeting took place in @entity41 , which was the seat of government under the @entity45 or @entity45 party before a civil war with the @entity47 forced @entity45 forces to flee to @entity1 in 1949 . ever since , the island and mainland @entity2 have been governed separately . the exclusion of two @entity1 reporters from covering the meeting has soured the start of @entity8 's historic visit , which is expected to last until friday . two journalists from @entity1 's @entity55 and @entity56 were excluded from a delegation of more than 80 reporters accompanying @entity8 , according to @entity59 , a press freedom watchdog . " the @entity2 government 's refusal to grant access to these journalists reflects two important trends -- the @entity47 's expansion of its tactics for influencing media from @entity70 to @entity1 , and the government 's use of visa denials as a way to punish overseas news outlets for critical coverage , " said @entity61 , senior research analyst at @entity59 . @entity1 's @entity33 said @entity8 would address protecting the freedom of the press at the meeting . @entity79 considers @entity1 a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification . @entity1 also calls itself the @entity1 . relations between the two sides have improved since @entity31 , of the @entity45 party , came to power in @entity1 's 2008 elections . @entity0 's @entity79 bureau contributed to this report
