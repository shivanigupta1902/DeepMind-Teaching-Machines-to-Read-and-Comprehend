( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 deserves amnesty and the ability to return to the @entity3 without fear of being incarcerated for reporting crimes by people in high places in the @entity3 government . monday 's ruling by @entity3 district judge @entity10 that the @entity12 's widespread collection of millions of @entity3 ' telephone records was unconstitutional bolsters this view . but for some , whether to give @entity1 amnesty is not an easy matter to reconcile . after all , they say , he broke laws in divulging classified information . indeed , some say he is a traitor . but just as a member of the @entity3 military is not required to follow an unlawful order , it is proper that an employee of the @entity3 intelligence community -- @entity12 , @entity29 , @entity30 and others -- should report any information that concerns law - breaking by the intelligence agencies or their employees . an @entity12 official 's suggestion that amnesty for @entity1 could possibly be put on the table was undoubtedly welcome news for @entity1 , yet @entity12 director gen. @entity41 rejected the suggestion . but how can anyone believe that @entity1 would not be deserving of amnesty ? clearly it is the government and its senior officials who committed the crime -- people who took oaths to defend the @entity49 from enemies both foreign and domestic and who failed to take to heart the words they swore to uphold . indeed , @entity1 did not -- nor does any government employee -- swear allegiance to the president of the @entity3 , or even to the secretary of defense or the director of @entity12 . no , he swore to uphold and defend the @entity49 . unfortunately , while federal law protects whistleblowers who work in other government sectors from reprisals for truth - telling and have paths for reporting wrongdoing and mismanagement , those who work in intelligence are expressly denied such rights . when senior staff representative @entity72 and longtime senior @entity12 employees @entity74 , @entity75 , and i submitted a formal complaint about mismanagement at the agency , the government 's response on july 26 , 2007 , was to send the @entity80 to raid our homes , searching them for seven hours and seizing our computers , phones and other digital media . we are just now getting our property back after having successfully sued the government in december 2012 . the government even indicted @entity89 , although it dropped its criminal charges in the case against him . still , for the five of us , it was the equivalent of a punch in the face and a warning to other would - be " truth - tellers " not to report wrongful government activities or the government will come after you . @entity1 clearly saw what the government does to whistleblowers who try to work within government to fix things that are wrong . he knew that our complaint to the @entity108 inspector general in september 2002 went for naught . although the report agreed that our complaint was well - founded , nothing happened -- no one was found guilty of wrongful behavior or waste of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars . even before writing the complaint , we -- all longtime and senior @entity12 employees -- along with @entity72 , a senior staffer on the @entity117 , had approached @entity119 in 2001 about the matter of illegal collection of data about @entity3 citizens . no action . @entity1 might have known that we were ultimately punished by approaching officials , and even had our security clearances revoked when the @entity80 raided our homes -- despite the fact that four of the five of us were not indicted and none of us was found guilty of committing a crime . for employees in the business of intelligence , there are no honest brokers , no viable paths to follow to report the subverting of the @entity3 @entity49 . it is the reason @entity1 went first to @entity142 and ultimately @entity143 to seek refuge . he did not go to those places to give away national secrets , rather he needed a place to stay that was safe from extradition and where he could wait while the @entity3 sorted through the facts , especially those regarding government leaders who violated the most basic of our nation 's laws -- the right to privacy . it was shocking to see the interview on @entity160 a few years ago with the former director of @entity12 , @entity162 , and hear him redefine the @entity163 of the @entity3 @entity49 . when asked whether @entity12 had violated the @entity163 , @entity162 said it had not . @entity162 said " probable cause " was not the @entity163 's standard for violating a citizen 's privacy -- it was based on " reasonable suspicion . " recognizing that the whole matter of secret presidential orders and extreme interpretations of the @entity49 in regard to executive wartime authorities by the @entity3 @entity174 could be the subject of a book by themselves , one thing is clear -- no one asked either the @entity179 or the people of the @entity3 whether bulk collection of citizens ' phone metadata was constitutional . as we saw on monday , judge @entity10 does not think so . in recent days , @entity162 defended the actions of both the @entity187 and @entity188 administrations , stating that the @entity12 collection program was " blessed " by all three branches of the @entity3 government . what @entity162 has not said is that neither the @entity193 nor @entity119 had a good understanding of what was going on . the @entity12 contends it provided @entity119 with the opportunity to be briefed on the surveillance , but some members of @entity119 dispute that . @entity1 's revelations since june have certainly made it clear that no one -- except the @entity12 -- believes they had the whole truth about the extensiveness of its data collection efforts , whether from the @entity207 or from the phone system . perhaps more germane to this discussion whether @entity1 should receive amnesty and the matter of who committed the real crime -- @entity1 or the government -- is that the legal basis for @entity12 in defending its actions can be found in a single court case called @entity218 v @entity219 ( 1979 ) -- which went to the @entity179 at a time when there was hardly an internet and nobody even dreamed there would be cell phones , social network sites or @entity227 . in this case , touted by the government as legitimizing the bulk collection of metadata under @entity232 of the @entity233 , the police inserted a recording device at the telephone company to record the metadata -- phone number originating the call , time of call , number called and duration of conversation -- associated with a man suspected of robbing a lady . the alleged thief challenged the constitutionality of the police recording the metadata associated with the phone call , but the @entity179 backed the lower court 's decision that doing so under the circumstances was constitutional . now , one might ask how does the @entity179 's approval of the collection of metadata associated with a single phone call made by a suspected thief end up authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata of hundreds of millions of @entity3 citizens by the most powerful spy agency in the world ? we all know that the field of law has its quirks , but it 's clear such an interpretation of law does not constitute justice , let alone make sense . with those facts as background , i think most @entity3 would agree that @entity1 deserves amnesty . in fact , it is those who allowed these programs to be implemented and developed over the past 12 years who should be prosecuted . after all , do we not stand for " equal justice for all " ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity283 .
