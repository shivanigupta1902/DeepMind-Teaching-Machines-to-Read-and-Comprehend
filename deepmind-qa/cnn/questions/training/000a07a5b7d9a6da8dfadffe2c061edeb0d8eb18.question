( @entity0 ) -- like most of us , you 've probably heard of graphic novels -- but have n't read too many . here are four new titles ( plus one classic ) that make you think , feel and daydream just like any other book . what it is one of the most moving and emotionally direct forms of the whole graphic genre is the memoir -- in part because it allows for all kinds of inventive approaches to telling life stories , such as using the drawings to show how people look and feel to the writer ( a huge , tall , monstery dad , for example ) . it also helps to have thoughtful , deeply poignant writing , which is exactly what you 'll find in @entity26 's " @entity25 . " this memoir of a young artist came out in 2008 , but it 's the one to start with if you 've never read a graphic book before . ( note : graphic novels can be novels , memoirs , biographies or anything in between . ) @entity37 uses text , drawings and even collages to re-create her violent , tv - saturated childhood , describing how she used art as her way out of the trailer park . " we do n't create a fantasy world to escape reality , " she says . " we create it to be able to stay . " discouraged at every turn by her parents and teachers , she grew into an adult who felt that she had little to say creatively and , further , that she could n't say that little well enough . that is , until she rediscovered an imaginary game from childhood , one that required her simply to sit very still in the corner of a room and wait for inanimate objects ( say , the pattern on the wallpaper ) to come " alive " and move . the magic of that moment and of all @entity37 's self - examinations is that her ideas apply to just about everybody . we 've all had those moments when we think we 're not good enough or original enough . her transformation belongs to all of us . @entity0 : how to @entity73 in 48 hours big questions " @entity83 " is just what a novel should be , if by novel we mean a very long story that creates an entire imaginary universe that involves us so deeply that we begin to think of ourselves as characters within it . the book is 585 pages long ( not including appendixes ) , a number that might seem overwhelming in a traditional format . in this case , you 'll finish in two days , not only because graphic novels contain a lot less text but also because you 'll race through the first time , desperate to figure out the big stuff , only to turn around and reread it in order to figure out all the little stuff you missed . the story takes place in an anonymous bucolic countryside ( trees , fields , the occasional house ) and follows a flock of birds , each with its own personality and philosophical struggles , from questioning the monotony of a seed diet to wondering about the true perils of snakes to considering " to what extent are we responsible for the fulfillment of our destinies ? " life goes on in this manner -- think , peck , think , peck -- until an undetonated bomb drops into their lives , a bomb that many ( but not all ) in the flock believe is a long , warm metal egg that may contain a savior baby bird . the hilarity and discord that result will astonish you , as will the pathos . some of the most poignant scenes concern two humans -- an elderly caretaker and her mentally disabled grandson or son -- who are watched by the birds . @entity138 's artwork here needs no words . the endless labor of the old woman -- firewood , dishes , scrub the floor , soak the dentures , weep in secret -- is drawn into brutal reality , as is her unexpected beauty . the six - panel homage to her brushing the long , young - looking hair you never knew she had ( it 's usually tied in a bun ) is , like the rest of the book , an unforgettable visual and emotional experience . @entity0 : 14 ways to have a @entity159 radioactive though @entity167 nominee " radioactive " is ostensibly a biography of @entity164 , its real allure is romance . twenty - four - year - old @entity169 travels to @entity170 from @entity171 and finds work in the laboratory of @entity174 , studying the relationship between heat and magnetism . the attraction is not just between molecules , however , and soon the scientists fall in love and marry . they go on , of course , to make incredible leaps and bounds in the world of science , discovering the elements polonium and radium . in this poignant tale of discovery and passion , @entity189 also examines the greater question of nuclear proliferation through the lens of the couple 's work , proving that their research is more than relevant today . a collage of different media , the artwork in the book includes drawings , as well as an electric blue background wash created by a process called cyanotype printing , in which light - sensitive chemicals soaked into paper become intensely bright when subjected to uv rays from the sun. @entity189 feels the technique " captured on the page what @entity169 called radium 's ' spontaneous luminosity . ' " @entity0 : first novels that may help @entity219 in 2012 i 'll be dead by the @entity221 technically , " i 'll be dead by the @entity221 : the @entity224 " is n't a graphic novel or even a graphic short story collection . maybe it 's best described as a graphic poetry collection : when @entity228 adds a line of dialogue to his stand - alone illustrations of a cat or jellyfish or ram , he creates something more resonant than a caption . the key to understanding ( and laughing and going " ouch ! " with recognition at ) these creations is reading the introduction , in which @entity228 describes how he collected bits of overheard conversations between his fellow humans . these verbal snippets , which sounded " bittersweet if not downright tragic , " led him to think it was " a bit absurd that we regularly torture ourselves with thoughts that seem at odds with our well - being . " and so he attached them as bubbles over the heads of nonhumans . thus , a bear will mournfully say , " everyone seems so young all of a sudden , " or a so - called proud lion will tell himself , " i need to shut up . " one of the marvels of the book is that the more you read , the more you smile , and then -- bam ! -- suddenly you 're wondering if you 're the cheetah or the snail . my advice : identify with the bumblebee who claims , " i know there 's happiness in me somewhere . " @entity0 : the best fiction of 2011 @entity272 in pictures do n't mistake this gorgeous and wholly original book for a blow - by - blow comic - book - style retelling of " @entity272 . " what artist @entity275 has done is create one drawing for and inspired by each page of @entity280 's 552 - page masterpiece ( for the record , the @entity283 version ) . the result is less a story and more a cabinet of visual and literary curiosities . each image -- rendered in ink , colored pencil or paint -- is accompanied by a single exquisite line from the novel , such as " but high above the flying scud and dark - rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel 's face " or " thus , while in life the great whale 's body may have been a real terror to his foes , in death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world . " only the most devoted " @entity272 " fans will need to read the whole creation sequentially . the rest of us will dip in and out , enjoying the interplay of the insanely beautiful words and images ( my favorite , on page 346 , is an anatomical drawing of a whale in vivid reds , blues and black ) and examining the connection between the two . the most solid and compelling narrative may actually be in the introduction , in which @entity275 describes not only his lifelong love for the original novel but also his lack of formal artistic education and the only place he had to work , " a closet that measures about three feet wide by six deep " inside of which he made 500 drawings . even if you do n't enjoy the book , let it sit on your coffee table as testament to what all of us human beings can do if we stick with it -- and believe in the great white whale of what we are doing . @entity0 : 16 books to make way for in january 2012 subscribe to @entity353 , @entity354 for up to 75 % off the newsstand price . that 's like getting 18 issues free . subscribe now ! @entity359 @entity358 , @entity360 .
