( @entity0 ) -- was it the end of the world at the summer box office ? there certainly was plenty of destruction to go around . not only were several cities destroyed , including @entity10 ( " @entity12 " ) and @entity11 ( " @entity13 " ) , there was also the kind of destruction @entity16 hates : that of their receipts . summer ticket sales , as of the last week in august , were down 15 % over summer 2013 , according to the @entity21 , quoting movie business tabulator @entity22 . for movies released in the may - august window , grosses were down a whopping 25 % -- $ 3.67 billion this year vs. $ 4.85 billion last year , according to boxofficemojo.com . nonetheless , with the exceptions of " @entity29 " and a handful of others , there was an " eh " feeling to much of what hit the multiplex between may and august of this year . @entity35 carnage , gross - out comedy , comic - book saviors : have n't we seen this movie before ? consider this : 2014 was the first summer since 2001 in which there was no movie that topped $ 300 million domestically . studios like to tout $ 200 million as a blockbuster benchmark , but $ 300 million is real high - flying territory : " @entity48 , " the " @entity50 " films , " @entity51 , " films with what they call " legs , " that create return business and draw in some lukewarm moviegoers . ( to be fair , " guardians " may still get there . ) as @entity62 ' @entity61 notes , there were various reasons for the down summer , and not all of them were bad : some planned films were rescheduled , and others were aimed as much at overseas markets as at the @entity70 . ( the mediocre " @entity72 " barely cracked $ 200 million in the @entity70 but earned another $ 500 million in international markets . ) still , the results provide a great deal of food for thought . here are a few points to ponder : 1 . do n't reach for the stars . @entity79 ( " @entity83 " ) , @entity80 ( " blended " ) and @entity81 ( " @entity82 " ) could n't carry their respective movies to blockbuster territory . only @entity86 ( " @entity87 " ) succeeded , with @entity88 ( " @entity89 " ) getting an honorable mention . however , it might be worth it to keep an eye on @entity94 , the up - and - coming light of " @entity96 . " sure , the film was based on a beloved book , but the film 's success caught many observers by surprise -- and @entity94 was at the center of it all . with her previous turn in the equally successful " @entity106 , " she 's coming on strong . 2 . blow it up good ! as mentioned , destruction was high on @entity16 's list , especially when @entity110 is involved . the @entity115 - directed " @entity114 " stomped on the planet again , " @entity113 " ( produced by @entity110 ) did some damage and " @entity12 " visited @entity10 . but more than destruction , apocalypse was in the air : witness " @entity83 , " " @entity120 " and " @entity121 : anarchy . " and we go to the movies to escape from real life ? 3 . comedy was not pretty . only two movies topped $ 100 million domestically among comedies this summer : " neighbors , " with the sneaky , shambling @entity129 , and " 22 jump street . " the latter was an interesting twist on the sequel , a follow - up that knew it was a follow - up and took every opportunity to make that the source of the comedy . ( in going along for the ride , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 were excellent self - parodies . ) but " @entity82 " performed tepidly ( though some may disagree ) , " @entity145 " found one more way to go and " @entity144 " was erased . you know what they say : dying is easy , comedy is hard . 4 . look to the @entity151 . who needs the @entity70 ? " transformers " had a relatively mediocre turnout in @entity70 , grossing less than $ 250 million -- good enough to become the no. 2 film of the summer , but only no. 4 among the four " transformers " films . on the other hand , overseas the film picked up $ 821 million -- including more than $ 300 million in @entity159 , becoming that country 's highest - grossing film of all time . that was no accident : @entity159 is the second biggest film market in the world , and @entity16 is catering to it more and more . 5 . time is your friend . perhaps the most talked - about film of the summer -- at least in markets where it has played -- is " boyhood , " @entity175 's ode to one child 's growing up . @entity175 took a risk in deciding to follow his protagonist , played by @entity179 , and his other actors for 12 years , trusting that a film shot over that time would come together . it worked beautifully , with a 99 % critics ' approval on @entity186 and early @entity188 talk . in the past , watching someone age in a film was a sociological curiosity : witness @entity193 's " @entity196 " films , which have revisited a group of students every seven years . now that we 're in the @entity200 age , in which every part of our lives is put on video , it 'll be interesting to see if @entity175 's concept becomes more normalized .

@placeholder market made " transformers " a blockbuster
