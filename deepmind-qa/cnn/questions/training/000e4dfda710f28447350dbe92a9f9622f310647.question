( @entity0 ) -- you 'll find his name and initials everywhere you go at the @entity5 -- the famous green and brick red logo stamped on everything from parasols and caps to towels and tennis balls . but ask most people who @entity14 was and they 'll tend to double fault . " for a lot of people in @entity23 and abroad , @entity20 is a tennis man , or a sometime president of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , " says @entity16 , head of collections and cultural mediation at the @entity19 . " everybody knows the name of @entity14 , but nobody knows who he was . that 's why we have an exhibition to explain that he is not a tennis champion , but a hero of @entity35 . " @entity20 ' elevated status was n't earned down in the trenches , but up in the skies above the @entity39 , as the exhibition at the @entity19 museum entitled " @entity42 ... @entity14 " explains . born in 1888 on the @entity23 island of @entity44 in the @entity45 , @entity20 had won fame before the war , notably becoming the first man to fly across the @entity49 in september 1913 . the following year , he switched from peacetime record - breaker to intrepid war pilot . pioneering propellers although he never reached the status of flying ace -- he is officially credited with shooting down four enemy aircraft during the war -- garros gained notoriety another way by developing a means of allowing a machine gun to be fired forward through a plane 's propeller arc . " he was an early pioneer in the development of fighter aviation , " says @entity64 , chief curator at the @entity66 's @entity65 . his method of attaching wedge - shaped steel plates to the propeller blades may have been crude , but it worked , says @entity64 . " the rate of fire was that most of the bullets would miss the propeller , but every so often one would strike it . so this was a way to deflect the bullets from the propeller , " @entity64 told @entity0 . " it was n't very efficient , but in the very early months of the war when airplanes were either defenseless or carrying hand - held weapons , this technique made his aircraft more lethal than anything flying . " over a very short period of time he shot down a number of @entity93 airplanes and created quite some terror among the @entity93 pilots . " piloting his @entity97 , @entity14 ' first victory came at the beginning of april 1915 and two more quickly followed . but his luck ran out later that month when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash - land behind enemy lines . captured by the @entity93 , @entity20 remained a prisoner of war for almost three years before escaping in february 1918 . short - lived success undeterred by the prospect of another incarceration or worse , @entity20 was soon airborne again , this time piloting a @entity109 biplane . the pioneering airman showed he had lost none of his shooting skills as he downed his fourth @entity93 plane of the war in early october 1918 . but it was n't long before disaster struck . on october 5 , a day before his 30th birthday and five weeks before @entity118 on november 11 , @entity20 was shot down and killed near the @entity23 town of @entity120 , close to the @entity122 border . his demise came at the hands of a @entity93 airman flying a @entity127 plane fitted with a synchronization gear that stopped bullets hitting the propeller altogether . designed by @entity134 aircraft manufacturer @entity132 , the device was far more efficient than @entity20 ' earlier deflector plates and caused numerous deaths of allied airmen when introduced in mid- 1915 -- prompting the @entity139 press to coin the phrase the " @entity141 . " garros had , it seems , become a victim of the rapid progress that he had started . " what you see in the @entity35 is this laboratory or crucible for development of what we know as air power today -- from a tactical / mission perspective as well as a technical design perspective , " @entity64 says . " a guy like @entity20 was one of the early pioneers of developing a tactic in an aircraft - specific role . but ideas of formation flying and how squadrons would tactically engage had evolved after he was in prison . " so when he came out , he was still pursuing fighter aviation like he had done in 1915 , but it was a different ball game by that point , " @entity64 said . " he was surpassed by the war and by this technique that he had pioneered . but he was a great war hero . " it was a status reaffirmed a decade after his death when a new stadium built to host the international teams tennis tournament now known as the @entity175 was named in @entity20 ' honor . after beating the @entity66 at @entity183 's @entity182 in 1927 , @entity23 , led by the " @entity177 " ( @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 ) went on to win five consecutive @entity175 titles at the new stadium in @entity186 ' 16th arrondissement beginning in 1928 -- the same year the @entity5 was first held at the clay - court venue . pre-war records @entity20 ' high - standing among the @entity23 public was n't built solely on his efforts during the war . prior to 1914 , he had been a highly successful member of a new burgeoning aircraft community which had rapidly grown in the wake of the @entity196 ' ( @entity195 and @entity197 ) first powered flight at @entity199 , @entity200 in december 1903 . " a lot of people do n't realize how much aeronautical activity was going on before the @entity35 , " says @entity64 . @entity23 was at the heart of this development , @entity64 says , noting @entity207 's first crossing of the @entity208 in an airplane in july 1909 which was followed a month later by the world 's first air meet at @entity212 in the @entity214 region . " it took place over a two - week period and upwards of 200,000 people came out to see the flying , " @entity64 says . " this was not an obscure event and by 1910 , ' 11 , ' 12 you have the foundation of an aircraft industry in @entity224 not just in @entity23 , but the @entity139 , @entity225 , @entity93 and @entity226 . " as the @entity19 exhibition notes , @entity20 was inspired to take up flying after attending the @entity212 event and it was n't long before he was making a name for himself . in 1912 , two years after making his first flight , he won the prestigious @entity233 race before becoming the first man to fly across the @entity49 on september 23 the following year , as flight international magazine reported . " tuesday last saw @entity14 achieve his ambition of flying across the @entity49 from @entity23 to @entity237 ... " leaving the @entity238 at @entity239 at 5.45 a.m. , and steering straight across the @entity49 , over @entity240 , he made a safe landing in @entity242 , in @entity243 at 1.45 p.m. the distance between the two points is about 460 miles , and after his eight hours flight there still remained in the tank five liters of petrol . " " the 1913 flight across the @entity49 was his great flight , " @entity64 says . " from a pre-war point of view , he was one of the key pioneering aviators who established the viability of the airplane as a technology in terms of these long - term flights . " these days , the only aviators you are likely to find at @entity14 stadium are pairs of sunglasses perched on patron 's noses court side at @entity265 ( who actually was a former @entity19 president ) . the pilot 's story may be lost on most of them , but 100 years after the @entity35 began , @entity20 ' fighting spirit lives on in more frivolous forms of battle . " @entity20 had two big qualities -- a lot of courage and a lot of determination , " @entity16 says . " those two words are perfect for our champions . " the " @entity42 ... @entity14 " exhibition can be seen at the @entity19 museum at @entity14 stadium . entry is free of charge to ticket - holders during the tournament .

captured by @placeholder , he escaped -- only to be killed months later
