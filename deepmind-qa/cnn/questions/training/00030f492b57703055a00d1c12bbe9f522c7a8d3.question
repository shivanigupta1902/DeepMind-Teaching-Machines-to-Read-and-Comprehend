@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 sen. @entity3 , whose @entity6 aspirations went into a nose dive last summer , clinched the @entity9 's presidential nomination tuesday night with a sweep of @entity9 contests in four states . " i am very , very grateful and pleased to note that tonight , my friends , we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence , humility and a great sense of responsibility , that i will be the @entity9 nominee for president of the @entity22 , " @entity3 told supporters in @entity1 . @entity2 estimates that @entity3 has amassed 1,195 delegates to the @entity9 's september convention in @entity25 , @entity26 , four more than the 1,191 needed to claim the party 's nomination . " now , we begin the most important part of our campaign : to make a respectful , determined and convincing case to the @entity22 people that our campaign and my election as president , given the alternative presented by our friends in the other party , is in the best interest in the country that we love , " @entity3 said . " the big battle 's to come , " he said . " i do not underestimate the significance nor the size of the challenge . " watch @entity3 address supporters after sweeping tuesday 's contests » @entity3 's last leading rival , former @entity49 gov. @entity48 , bowed out of the race after his projected losses in @entity1 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 and urged his supporters to back the @entity4 senator in november . " it 's now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been but now what must be , and that is a united party , " @entity48 said . watch as @entity48 ends his presidential bid » claiming the title of presumptive nominee will give @entity3 a head start on the general election campaign while @entity71 contenders @entity69 and @entity72 are still locked in a battle for their party 's title , said @entity77 , a @entity9 strategist and @entity2 contributor . allocate delegates yourself and see how the numbers add up » " tomorrow , he can get started , " @entity77 said . " he 'll have the [ @entity83 ] behind him . he 'll have a broad base of financial support . it 's a big step . meanwhile , it looks like the @entity71 are engaged in the land war across @entity89 , so he 's got a big advantage now . " both @entity93 , the @entity95 senator and former first lady , and @entity72 , the first - term senator from @entity97 , called @entity3 on tuesday night , campaign officials said . @entity72 told @entity3 he looks forward to running against him in the fall , campaign spokeswoman @entity98 said . @entity3 is slated to go to the @entity6 on wednesday to receive the endorsement of president @entity101 , according to two @entity9 sources . the @entity4 senator 's campaign -- his second run for the @entity6 -- was largely written off last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party 's conservative base , a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising . but the former @entity112 pilot and @entity114 prisoner of war rebounded with wins in january 's primaries in @entity117 and @entity118 , the state where his first presidential bid foundered . " there were times , obviously , when my political campaign was not viewed as the most viable in @entity22 , as you probably know , " he told reporters in @entity125 earlier tuesday . " in fact , i was reminded of the words of chairman @entity129 , who said it 's always darkest before it 's totally black . " @entity3 's fortunes also rebounded as @entity22 commanders in @entity133 credited the 2007 launch of a campaign to pacify @entity136 and its surrounding provinces with a sharp decline in @entity22 and @entity133 casualties . the senator had been one of the most outspoken advocates of the shift and has blasted his potential @entity71 rivals for calling for the withdrawal of @entity22 combat troops from the widely unpopular war . " this is a man with a lot of trials in his life , " said former education secretary @entity147 , a @entity2 contributor . " he 's had a lot of downs ; he 's been up , and this is a big up . " @entity3 has been turning his fire on the @entity71 , for whom tuesday 's races in @entity52 and @entity1 are seen as pivotal . see scenes from tuesday 's voting » but @entity71 have been pounding @entity3 over his january comment that he would be satisfied if @entity22 troops remained in @entity133 for 100 years , as long as the insurgency there died down . and @entity165 chairman @entity164 has attacked his reputation as a reformer over the past week , accusing @entity3 of trying to evade federal spending limits by opting out of public financing after using the promise of federal funds to obtain a bank loan and automatic ballot access for his primary campaign . @entity164 told @entity2 on tuesday that @entity3 " really is the focus of what we 're doing now , in terms of his ethics problems and his problems with the war and his problems with the huge deficits that they 've run up on the @entity9 side . " in 2000 , @entity3 upset then - @entity1 gov. @entity101 in the @entity117 primary by touting " straight talk " and his record as a @entity9 maverick . @entity101 came back in @entity118 amid a divisive and bitter campaign that left @entity3 denouncing leaders of the party 's religious conservative wing as " agents of intolerance , " and @entity101 went on to win the presidency . since then , @entity3 has enraged conservative leaders by opposing @entity101 's signature tax cuts , co-sponsoring the campaign finance reform law that now bears his name and supporting a controversial @entity6 - backed plan to offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants . but their support was spread among a fractured @entity9 field , and their main standard - bearer , former @entity208 gov. @entity207 , quit the race after a disappointing showing in february 's @entity212 primaries . exit polls in @entity1 and @entity52 found that about three - quarters of @entity9 would be satisfied with @entity3 as their nominee , however . those surveys found that the economy was the top issue for @entity9 voters in both states -- and by a wide margin in @entity52 , which has seen a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in the past decade . although national security issues are a strong suit for @entity3 , @entity77 said he might need some help if a weakening economy is the central issue in november . " it 's never been sen. @entity3 's strength , " @entity77 said . he said @entity3 would need to make the case that " i 'm going to grow this economy ; @entity72 or @entity69 , they 're going to grow government . " @entity3 had amassed 1,047 delegates before tuesday , according to @entity2 estimates . at stake in tuesday 's contests were 256 delegates , allocated on a winner - take - all basis by statewide or congressional district results . e-mail to a friend @entity2 correspondent @entity244 and political editor @entity245 contributed to this report .
