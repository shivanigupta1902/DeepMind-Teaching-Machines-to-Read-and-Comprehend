" five involve sexual assaults on children and one was a ' near miss , ' " it said . " of particular interest to the team is that one of the new sexual assaults took place in @entity22 in 2005 . " all but one of the six offenses had been reported to the @entity5 police at the time of the @entity24 's disappearance , the @entity10 said . " these new cases are similar to a number of the originally identified ( 12 offenses ) whereby a male intruder has gained access to holiday villas occupied by @entity56 families in the @entity57 , " the force said . investigators request @entity5 interviews of the 18 potentially linked incidents , five were in @entity61 , nine in the @entity63 district , three in @entity22 and one in @entity65 . the offenses in @entity22 occurred between 2005 and 2010 . when police appealed for information last month , they said witnesses described the intruder as being tanned with short , dark , unkempt hair . the man was said to have spoken in @entity74 with an accent , and his voice was described as slow , or possibly slurred . no new information about the suspect was given wednesday . in october , new police sketches were released of potential suspects in the case , and @entity56 police appeared in a television appeal for information . the program prompted a flurry of tips , and police in @entity5 announced they would reopen the case . since then , the @entity5 investigation has run parallel to the @entity56 one . detectives previously said they were investigating a spike in break - ins in the area in the weeks before @entity24 disappeared , two in the same block where her family was staying . neither her parents , @entity98 and @entity99 , nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from @entity103 , @entity74 . @entity0 's @entity104 and @entity105 contributed to this report .
