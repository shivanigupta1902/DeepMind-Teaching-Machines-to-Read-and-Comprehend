( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's king asked the head of a moderate @entity5 party to form a government tuesday , state media said , after the party claimed victory in the country 's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms this summer . the @entity13 , or @entity14 , is expected to form a coalition government after it won 107 of the 395 seats contested in friday 's vote . king @entity19 appointed @entity20 , the party 's secretary - general , as head of the new government tuesday and asked him to form a @entity24 , the official news agency @entity18 reported . @entity20 , a former managing director of three newspapers and a father of six , was elected secretary - general of the @entity14 in 2008 , @entity18 says . according to its website , the @entity14 previously participated in elections in 1997 , 2002 and 2007 . the party won 46 seats in 2007 and 42 in 2002 , after taking just nine seats in 1997 . @entity33 , senior lecturer in @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity36 , said the @entity14 's result this time round constituted " remarkable progress -- much higher than anticipated by anyone , and also much , much better than any of the party 's competitors . " the margin of victory for the @entity14 surprised many observers , she said , and suggests that those protesting against the country 's governing elite in recent months are truly fed up . " i think we are witnessing an @entity5 wave in the @entity34 , with so - called @entity5 moderates winning not only in @entity52 , but also in @entity53 and @entity2 , and possibly also in @entity54 , " storm said . " it gives an indication of the sentiments of the general population in these countries , and ( of ) the state of the political opposition there too , as the @entity64 in many cases have been the most visible opposition force , and the best organized too . " the @entity14 is more moderate than @entity52 's governing @entity14 or the @entity64 who won power in @entity53 elections last month , @entity48 said . the party 's online mission statement lists three values -- authenticity , justice and development -- and makes little mention of @entity64 . authenticity " has to be consistent with our values , culture and civilization , with the incorporation and respect for the cultural , linguistic and ethnic groups , within the space of the @entity64 brotherhood , " the statement says . under the new constitution , approved by referendum in july , both @entity87 and the prime minister have greater powers , while the monarch 's sway has been slightly lessened . the changes -- which mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- came after thousands of @entity2 took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year , inspired by what became known as the @entity100 . the youth - based february 20 movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies . @entity0 's @entity107 contributed to this report .
