( @entity0 ) -- will the @entity2 arrest of one of @entity5 's highest - paid television actors spell the end of his career ? when that actor is @entity10 , the answer is probably not . @entity10 , 44 , whose real name is @entity10 , has known scandal before and has worked each of his arrests , divorces and indiscretions into the canon of bad - boy lore that has made him essentially scandal - proof . " @entity10 has bounced back from various scandals , and i do n't think anyone expects anything more from him , " said public relations expert @entity23 , founder and chief visibility officer of @entity26 " bad - boy behavior is part of his persona that 's been a work in progress since the 1980s . he has bounced back time and time again . " the latest scandal to rock @entity10 's world is his december 25 arrest in @entity38 , @entity39 , on second - degree assault and menacing charges , both felonies , and criminal mischief , a misdemeanor . @entity10 has been married to sometime actress and real estate investor @entity46 , 32 , his third wife , since may 2008 . the couple have twin sons who were born in march . they were reportedly having an argument when he was arrested . a 911 call released by @entity38 police on monday revealed @entity46 reporting a domestic abuse case and alleging that @entity10 was threatening her with a knife . @entity10 's publicist @entity57 issued a statement following the arrest on friday urging against a rush to judgment against his client . " do not be misled by appearance , " @entity57 said . " appearance and reality can be as different as night and day . it would benefit everyone not to jump to any conclusion . " while any claims of violence against women , whether real or alleged , can be career ending for a celebrity , @entity10 seems to be a special case . this is not the first time he has been at the center of a domestic violence scandal , and the stories do n't seem to harm his reputation . @entity10 's long history of questionable behavior began in 1990 when he was dating actress @entity82 . reports surfaced then that @entity84 had been shot in the arm . in 2001 @entity10 explained to @entity86 that it was a " complete accident . i was n't even in the room . she picked up a pair of my pants . ... a little revolver fell out of my back pocket , hit the bathroom floor and went off . it shot a hole through the toilet and she got hit in the leg with shrapnel . " the couple split soon after the incident and @entity84 married actor @entity103 in 1991 . in 1994 @entity10 was the only celebrity client whose name was publicly released during the trial of " @entity106 " @entity106 . in 1996 adult film actress @entity107 accused @entity10 of throwing her on the floor and splitting her lip . @entity10 pleaded no contest to battery charges and was fined $ 2,800 . he entered rehab in 1998 after an alleged drug overdose . during the course of his divorce from model - turned - actress @entity114 in 2006 , @entity114 filed a restraining order against @entity10 , claiming he tried to kill her . @entity10 released a statement at the time saying : " obviously , what has taken place is vile , is unconscionable , is without merit , is a transparent and immature smear campaign . she 's claiming certain things . it 's baseless . " @entity10 and @entity114 have continued to have a rocky relationship , often arguing over issues regarding the couple 's two children @entity129 , 5 , and @entity130 , 4 . @entity10 is currently a high - profile pitchman for @entity132 clothing products . in one recent commercial , as he attempts to talk with retired basketball star @entity133 , he buffoonishly crashes his car and is cheered on for his antics by a parking valet . @entity138 , who teaches public relations at @entity140 , believes that the most recent incident wo n't harm @entity10 's status as a commercial spokesperson . he compares @entity46 with @entity144 , who was dropped by a number of sponsors in the wake of his own sex scandal where he admitted infidelity , though @entity144 unlike @entity10 has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing . " the @entity10 scandal is a pretty stark contrast to @entity144 . this behavior is built into the fabric of @entity10 's bad - boy profile , unlike with @entity144 where it was unexpected , " said @entity138 . " so i think he will bounce back as long as his popularity on his show remains high . people were shocked with @entity144 because the behavior did n't fit the image . people are much less shocked with @entity10 because the behavior does fit the image . " @entity10 , the son of actor @entity163 , had his breakthrough film role in 1986 in the @entity166 drama " @entity167 . " in 1987 he starred with his father in the ode to 1980 's greed , " @entity171 . " he also appeared in the comedy franchises " @entity173 " and " @entity174 . " in 2003 @entity10 was cast as the lothario brother @entity175 on the @entity177 sitcom " @entity179 , " along with @entity178 . his character -- a freewheeling and hedonistic commercial jingle writer whose life is complicated when his divorced brother and nephew move into his beach house -- was loosely based on @entity10 's own rogue image . in may @entity177 renewed the series for three more seasons and in 2008 @entity10 topped the list of the highest - paid actors on television , earning a reported $ 825,000 per episode . " @entity179 " has an average run of 23 episodes per year . a representative for @entity10 said in an e-mail monday that his client would not be losing his endorsement deal with @entity132 or his role on " @entity179 . " calls and e-mails to @entity177 regarding @entity10 's future on the show were not returned , but veteran showbiz observers agree that because @entity10 's alter ego on the show depends in part on @entity10 's real - life shenanigans , his role should not be in jeopardy . " business is going to continue as usual for @entity10 after the holidays are over , " said @entity210 , crisis manager and president of @entity213 . " the events of the past week have been sad , but not surprising , and definitely not career - ending . "

@entity114 filed a restraining order against @placeholder during their divorce in 2006
