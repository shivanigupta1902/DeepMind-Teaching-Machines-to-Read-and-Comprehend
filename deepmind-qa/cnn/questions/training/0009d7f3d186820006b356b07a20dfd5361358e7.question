@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- even as it prepares to hand over the @entity4 embassy in @entity0 to the rebel government , the @entity2 is warning the @entity6 to get its act together . an administration official told @entity1 the @entity9 has warned the @entity6 that this is a " do - or - die moment " for the organization to carry out a credible and thorough investigation of the killing of its military commander , @entity14 . last week 's mysterious assassination has raised concerns that it might have been carried out by feuding groups within the rebels themselves . " we do welcome the @entity6 's move to set up an impartial committee that will investigate the incident and we look forward to hearing the results , " deputy spokesman @entity21 told reporters monday . " it 's important that , given the fluidness of the situation on the ground , that the @entity6 work to ensure that it takes the right kinds of actions , such as an investigation into the death , and sends a clear and transparent message that they speak on behalf of the @entity4 opposition and the @entity4 people and that they are diligently carrying out their mandate . " the @entity6 has been rocked by internal divisions , with rival rebel groups battling each other . the divisions create a dilemma for the @entity49 administration , which recognized the rebel movement based in @entity51 as @entity4 's rightful government on july 15 at an international meeting on @entity4 in @entity54 . the move , done in coordination with the international community , paves the way for the @entity9 to reopen the embassy , accredit diplomats and unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen assets . the internal strife within the rebel movement comes as the @entity2 prepares to hand over the @entity4 embassy to the @entity6 as the recognized government of @entity4 , according to @entity9 officials . the officials say the move would allow the @entity6 to re-open the embassy , accredit diplomats and regain control of the embassy 's frozen bank account , worth about $ 13 million . it follows a formal request from the @entity6 to re-open the embassy under its control and accredit @entity76 , the former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity9 , as its charge d'affaires . in march , the @entity2 ordered the @entity4 embassy in @entity0 closed and kicked diplomats loyal to @entity4 leader @entity80 out of the country . @entity76 had resigned his post as the regime 's ambassador to the @entity9 in february and has since represented the opposition in @entity0 . " we are consulting with the @entity6 on a broad range of issues , and that includes diplomatic accreditation and representation , " @entity21 said . despite the divisions within the @entity6 , the @entity2 publicly expressed confidence in the rebels . " we believe that this is the legitimate representatives of the @entity4 people during this transition period , " @entity21 said . " this is an extremely challenging period for @entity4 and they are dealing with these challenges as they come . but we have confidence that they can weather this . " but privately , @entity9 officials acknowledge there is some concern about the apparent disarray within the rebel movement , although officials say it is not surprising . " this is a tribal society , " one official said . " we knew from the start this could be messy and there was always the concern about not moving too fast . we had no illusions about the @entity6 , but they have done a pretty good job and look better to us than @entity80 at this point . " @entity122 has been bombing @entity4 for more than four months under a @entity124 mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to @entity80 , who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country . the @entity9 @entity131 in @entity132 was shuttered and @entity9 personnel evacuated by sea and air in late february , after the current revolt against @entity80 erupted . @entity4 and @entity9 officials held face - to - face talks in @entity139 last month , but @entity0 says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that @entity80 " must go . " also sunday , state tv aired video of @entity145 , @entity80 's son , speaking to what was described as displaced families . he has not been seen speaking in public for weeks . " whether @entity122 stays or not , the battle will continue until @entity4 is freed , " he said , stressing the right of people to fight . " let me say to you that the battle will not stop . every one of you : return to your homes and farms and villages and jobs with peace of mind . we will not stop ! "
