( @entity0 ) -- tennis top dogs are out to avoid another " @entity2 " at @entity3 . exactly a year ago , the famous grass - court grand slam experienced one of the weirdest days in its history as former champions @entity9 and @entity11 were knocked out and no less than seven players withdrew injured . this year , however , defending champion @entity13 sidestepped a potential banana skin with an effortless 6 - 1 6 - 1 6 - 0 victory over world no. 92 @entity17 . " i played well today , " said the world no. 3 , who next plays @entity22 27th seed @entity20 . " he 's just come out of college and broken into the top 100 so it was tough for him but he 's got a good game . " @entity13 , who reached the @entity28 semifinal after a series of five - set slogs , was relieved to wrap up the second round match in just under 90 minutes . " i felt like that cost me a little bit at the @entity28 , " he added . " if you can finish matches as quickly as possible it definitely helps in the long run . " second seed @entity38 had a few more problems in his second - round match , finally overcoming veteran @entity43 @entity42 -- who beat @entity13 at @entity44 this month . the @entity47 world @entity45 triumphed 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) in three hours 17 minutes to set up a clash with @entity50 @entity49 , who beat @entity51 of the @entity52 in straight sets . " i was two sets up and had some break - point chances in the third and i should have closed it out in the third set tie - breaker , but credit to him for fighting , " said @entity38 , the @entity58 winner and runner - up last year . " he 's 35 years old but he 's moving very well . grass is probably his most preferred surface . he performs really well on the big stages as you saw , " added @entity38 , who lost the @entity28 final against @entity66 this month . " he loves to engage the crowd , he 's an entertainer , and it was fun from one side to be part of a great thrilling match , but on the other side i should not have complicated my own life this way . " @entity79 @entity78 sent out a warning by sensationally repeating his " @entity2 " antics . last year , @entity78 was a shock winner against @entity9 , saying afterwards : " i can definitely tell my grandkids that i kicked the butt of @entity9 . " the world no. 90 kicked ass again on the @entity3 grass , this time sending in - form @entity89 @entity88 packing 6 - 4 6 - 3 7 - 6 victory to book his place in the third round , where he faces @entity94 's @entity93 . " nothing was working from my side , " @entity88 , the world @entity95 , told reporters . " two of my biggest weapons , my serve and return , were n't there . " a lot of credit to @entity78 . that 's why he beat @entity9 last year on grass . the guy has a good game plan . he comes in , he chips the ball , he takes out the pace . " @entity113 's seventh seed @entity111 also succumbed to grass - court giantkilling , losing 6 - 7 6 - 0 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 to 2009 junior @entity3 champion @entity116 @entity115 , who next plays @entity118 's @entity117 . it 's the first time in 18 grand slams that @entity111 had failed to reach the third round . sixth seed @entity122 went through to round three beating @entity125 @entity124 , while @entity127 's champion @entity126 also progressed along with @entity130 16th seed @entity128 , @entity131 no. 20 @entity132 , @entity79 's @entity133 and @entity135 's @entity134 . in the women 's draw , there was one upset as former world no. 1 @entity140 crashed out in the second round , with the eighth seed from @entity143 losing 6 - 3 3 - 6 7 - 5 to 45th - ranked @entity47 @entity144 . @entity146 champion @entity145 ticked off a 6 - 2 6 - 2 victory against @entity149 @entity148 , and the @entity151 star will next play @entity43 @entity152 . the 2011 @entity3 champion @entity153 dropped just two games as she eased past @entity156 @entity155 , and the @entity43 will next face five - time winner @entity157 -- who advanced to the third round with a 7 - 6 6 - 1 victory over @entity159 . @entity162 fourth seed @entity160 , a finalist in 2012 , swept aside @entity125 @entity163 6 - 4 6 - 0 while former no. 1 @entity164 also triumphed .
