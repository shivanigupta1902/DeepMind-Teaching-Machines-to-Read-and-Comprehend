( @entity0 ) -- in two operations in @entity4 nearly 3,000 miles apart , @entity2 military forces went after two high - value targets over the weekend . one operation took place early saturday in the @entity9 capital of @entity10 , when members of the elite @entity2 army @entity12 captured @entity13 , an @entity15 operative wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two @entity2 embassies in @entity4 . in the second raid , a team of @entity20 in southern @entity21 targeted a foreign fighter commander for @entity24 , a terrorist group linked with @entity15 , according to a senior @entity26 administration official . early - morning capture @entity30 , 49 , was returning to his house after morning prayers around 6:30 a.m. ( friday night @entity33 ) when a group of at least 10 men in four vehicles surprised him , his wife told @entity0 . @entity37 said some of the men were wearing masks and some were n't . she said the unmasked men looked like @entity9 to her and spoke @entity43 with @entity9 accents . she could n't say whether the other men were @entity2 . the capture was over very quickly , she said . she disputed reports that her husband of 22 years was reaching for a gun when he was taken . she said he broke with @entity15 in 1996 and had no role in the embassy bombings two years later , and he had even tried recently to clear his name . the saturday operation was conducted with the knowledge of the @entity9 government , said one @entity2 official . the @entity58 said the @entity2 military was holding @entity13 in a " secure location " outside @entity9 . he eventually will be taken to @entity61 , a source with knowledge of the capture and proceedings told @entity0 . the @entity9 interim government called the @entity2 capture a kidnapping and has requested an explanation from @entity72 about the raid , the country 's state news agency reported sunday . @entity9 emphasized its citizens should be tried in @entity9 if they are facing charges , @entity74 reported . president @entity26 approved the two raids , monitored them closely and was updated regularly by homeland security adviser @entity80 and his national security staff , @entity78 spokeswoman @entity77 told @entity0 on sunday . " this operation should be a clear reminder that the @entity2 will seek justice against those who would attack @entity2 , and never forgets those who are victims of terrorism , " the @entity82 said sunday . and in a written statement sunday , defense secretary @entity89 said the raids " send a strong message to the world that the @entity2 will spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable , no matter where they hide or how long they evade justice . " " we will continue to maintain relentless pressure on terrorist groups that threaten our people or our interests , and we will conduct direct action against them , if necessary , that is consistent with our laws and our values , " @entity98 said . @entity108 involved in @entity21 in the @entity21 raid , members of the @entity20 's @entity108 targeted a foreign fighter commander for @entity24 named @entity112 , a senior @entity26 administration official said sunday . a @entity115 of @entity21 origin , @entity112 is associated with now - deceased @entity15 operatives @entity117 and @entity119 , who played roles in the 1998 embassy bombing in @entity122 and the 2002 attacks on a hotel and airline in @entity126 , all in @entity115 , the official said . @entity15 claimed responsibility for all three . the @entity122 embassy attack claimed 213 lives and wounded 4,500 people . in the 2002 attacks , three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside the @entity135 - owned @entity134 in @entity126 , killing the bombers as well as 12 @entity115 and three @entity135 . the same morning , a missile attack unsuccessfully targeted an @entity135 airliner taking off from @entity126 's airport . local residents said the compound targeted by the @entity2 was the home of @entity24 leader @entity143 , also known as @entity144 , and an @entity24 spokesman claimed @entity144 was the target of the attack . @entity108 is the same unit that killed @entity148 in @entity149 in 2011 . the @entity20 came under fire and withdrew before they could confirm whether they killed their target , a senior @entity2 official said . a second administration official said the commandos withdrew to avoid civilian casualties . the operations were carried out even as polls show @entity2 are skittish about @entity2 military involvement in overseas conflicts . this means others who might be in @entity2 crosshairs could have more reason to worry , said retired lt. col. @entity164 , a @entity0 military analyst . " one ( mission ) could have gone without the other , " @entity164 said . " but the fact that they did them both , i think , is a real signal that the @entity2 -- no matter how long it takes -- will go after these targets . " speaking to reporters at the @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity2 secretary of state @entity174 said the raids ought to make clear that the @entity2 " will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror . " " those members of @entity15 and other terrorist organizations literally can run , " he said , " but they ca n't hide . " @entity30 tied to @entity2 embassy bombings @entity30 , has been on the radar for years . he was on the @entity191 's " @entity192 " list , with a $ 5 million reward offered for information leading to his arrest or conviction . he is alleged to have played a key role in the august 7 , 1998 , bombings of @entity2 embassies in @entity122 , @entity115 ; and @entity200 , @entity201 . more than 200 people were killed and another 5,000 wounded in the @entity115 attack ; 11 died in the @entity201 incident . @entity30 has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to kill @entity2 nationals , murder , destruction of @entity2 buildings and government property , and destruction of national defense utilities of the @entity2 . as early as december 2010 , @entity9 authorities told a @entity217 committee that @entity13 was living there , even providing a @entity10 address for him . @entity2 officials wanted @entity13 to face trial in an @entity2 court . but , counterterrorism analysts told @entity0 , he may not have been apprehended at the time because of the delicate security situation in much of @entity9 . there , ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the @entity226 -- held considerable sway after the ouster of longtime leader @entity229 . " it 's a huge deal to get him , " said @entity0 's @entity230 , who has long been covering @entity15 . " he 's a big player in @entity15 ( and ) he is in one of the key target areas , the north of @entity4 . " beyond any psychological impact on the terrorist group , @entity13 's capture could potentially yield a wealth of information about @entity15 's plans and capabilities . the terrorist network has shown particular strength of late in @entity4 . " clearly , he may have useful information about the strength of @entity15 and the @entity248 in @entity9 , " @entity230 said . " he is somebody who is senior within @entity15 . he was well respected , a good operative . " @entity24 blamed for @entity115 mall attack @entity24 long has been a target of @entity72 as well : it was designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2008 . the group is seeking to turn @entity21 into a fundamentalist @entity248 state , though it has carried out attacks in other @entity4 countries as well . the attack on @entity122 's @entity258 on september 21 thrust @entity24 into the spotlight once again . @entity72 vowed to support @entity115 's government after the bloody raid , which killed at least 67 people . the @entity20 raid on @entity24 took place before dawn saturday ( late friday night @entity33 ) in the southern @entity21 port city of @entity267 . @entity268 , an @entity24 spokesman , said at least one @entity24 fighter was killed in the gunfight . but no @entity2 personnel were injured or killed , a @entity2 official said . in recent months , @entity24 's haven in south - central @entity21 has been been increasingly squeezed as @entity115 forces fight the group from the south and @entity278 forces come down from @entity279 , the @entity21 capital . at the same time , @entity24 has become even more closely aligned with @entity15 . the two groups effectively merged last year , said @entity0 national security analyst @entity281 . " this is a group that has adopted @entity15 's ideology wholesale , " @entity281 said . " the reason they attacked the mall was not only because it was @entity115 , but also because it attracted a fair number of @entity290 businessmen and others living in @entity122 . " ' @entity292 nabbed in native @entity9 after years tied to @entity15 @entity2 officials : @entity20 launch raid on @entity24 leader
