( @entity0 ) -- modern football is a melting pot of cultures , as players from a variety of ethnic backgrounds share top billing as superstars . it is not always a comfortable mix , as can be seen by the recent racism rows involving @entity12 and @entity13 . but football 's pantheon of stars has not always been such a rich multicultural tapestry . far from it . back in the sport 's infancy in the late 1800s , in its homeland of white - dominated @entity22 , there were no official leagues and only a handful of domestic cup competitions . international matches were the pinnacle of competition , with @entity31 and @entity32 contesting the first in 1872 -- and few were played outside the @entity22 and @entity35 until the formation of @entity37 in 1904 . and it was @entity32 which , in 1881 , provided football with its first black international player -- @entity42 - born @entity43 . " he was the son of a @entity47 merchant who traded out in the @entity49 and parts of @entity51 as well , " curator of the @entity45 told @entity0 . " it 's a story of the time , i suppose . @entity43 would 've been born out of wedlock to a wealthy white merchant and his mother who was native to @entity42 . " @entity60 attitudes of the time meant that @entity43 , while enjoying financial support and a good education , was never truly recognized and acknowledged by his father . " anything that had to be signed , due to school or education , was usually done through an intermediary , " @entity65 explained . " so he was recognized as being of the blood , but there was a distance . " early records of @entity43 show him joining @entity47 team @entity74 -- which at the time enjoyed a higher profile than now - famous neighbors @entity78 -- in both a playing and off - pitch capacity . in his role as match secretary , @entity43 created history by becoming the first black football administrator . in 1880 he joined @entity85 , the biggest of the @entity47 clubs and @entity32 's preeminent football power . the following year he represented @entity32 in his first of three international outings , captaining the country in a landmark 6 - 1 victory over @entity31 at @entity94 's @entity93 ground -- now an international cricket venue . " even to this day with some of the fantastic teams @entity31 have played over the years , such as the @entity97 of 1953 and @entity99 's @entity98 , that victory for @entity32 remains @entity31 's heaviest defeat on home soil , " said @entity65 . the @entity32 team led by @entity43 pioneered a revolutionary passing game at a time when football was played in a very individual manner . " he is a hugely important figure within football . he captained @entity32 against @entity31 , which was absolutely the highest accolade you could have at the time . it was also at a time when @entity32 were very successful in international football , " @entity65 said . " the way the game was played at that time , @entity32 were devising a short passing game . the margin of victory was because @entity32 were the first to promote a real team - based passing ethos . @entity43 was right at the forefront of that . " despite his prominent role in the national team , @entity43 still occasionally encountered abuse which was symbolic of a less enlightened age . " what we come across in a very polite article about @entity43 is that he encountered ' splenetic players ' on the field . now that suggests to me that the color of his skin was a subject of attack , " @entity65 said . " that 's an insight into the fact that , even in that time , this was clearly happening and @entity43 had to rise above that as a footballer and more widely as a human being . " @entity43 's demeanor off the pitch is something @entity65 believes is also of note , saying he had a reputation as a gentleman . " certainly there is widespread praise that he wins . the adoration that he has is clearly because he manages to rise above the difficulties that he encounters on the field of play . " after leaving @entity85 , @entity43 headed to @entity31 to play for the now - defunct @entity157 club in @entity94 . @entity65 believes @entity43 became the first black player to play in the @entity159 during the 1882 - 83 season . @entity43 passed away in @entity161 , @entity162 in 1902 aged 44 , but @entity65 thinks the contribution he made to football has paved the way for the big - name black players we see in the game today . " he 's massively important to global football , not just @entity172 football , not just @entity42 football . he 's one of the first few pioneers . he played international football , he captained the international team and they happened to be the best there was at that time . " as football spreads across the globe with black players who are now among the best in the world , and you look at the legacy of fantastic @entity187 players like @entity99 and @entity188 , it really stems back to guys like @entity43 . "
