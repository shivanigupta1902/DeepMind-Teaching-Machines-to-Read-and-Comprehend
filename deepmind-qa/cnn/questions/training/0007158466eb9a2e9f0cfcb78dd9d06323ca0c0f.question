( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 manager @entity1 has told @entity4 's @entity3 to decide where his future lies after the @entity7 striker starred in a goalless draw between the two teams on monday . @entity2 have seen two bids rejected by @entity4 for @entity3 , who has been the subject of almost constant speculation throughout the transfer window . when asked in his post-match press conference whether he wanted @entity3 to publicly make his intentions clear , @entity1 responded : " yes , i would . " @entity3 started for @entity4 in @entity17 ' first competitive match at @entity18 since replacing @entity19 as manager . @entity17 is adamant @entity3 will remain in @entity21 , but it did not stop @entity1 saying last week that @entity2 would return with a third bid for the former @entity25 player . @entity3 , 27 , joined @entity4 in 2004 and he is the fourth highest goalscorer in the club 's history , having found the net 197 times in 404 appearances . @entity1 intimated he had been alerted to @entity3 's desire to leave @entity4 and now he has called on the player to conclude the issue once and for all . " i think the person that started the story has to finish the story , " continued the former @entity34 and @entity35 coach . " a club like us , a manager like me , the people that work in the club with me , we are not silly to try to get a player from a big club , a big club that does n't sell what they do n't want to sell . " we are not silly to try something if somebody did n't start [ it ] . " blog : can @entity53 meet @entity4 challenge ? " do you want me to tell you what for me is the most important thing ? " @entity1 continued . " it is that he played very well . " he was a real professional , playing for his club , playing for the club that pays him . he tried to win , tried to score . he was fantastic . " after that he wants to leave ? he has to say . or he decided now he does n't want to leave any more . his problem . but i praise him because he was fantastic , he played a fantastic match in difficult circumstances . " the draw leaves @entity2 top of the @entity68 with two wins and a draw from their opening three matches . defending champions @entity4 have four points , a win and a draw , from their opening two matches .
