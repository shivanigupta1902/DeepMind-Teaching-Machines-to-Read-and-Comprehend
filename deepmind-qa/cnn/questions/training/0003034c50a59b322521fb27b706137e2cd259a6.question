( @entity0 ) -- six months ago , @entity1 was lying in a hospital bed , recovering from a @entity4 attack in which she was shot point - blank in the head and neck . the shooting was meant to silence , once and for all , the outspoken @entity9 teenager who had dared to defy the @entity4 's ban against girls in school . but it backfired : instead of silencing the 15 - year - old , the attack only made her voice more powerful . @entity1 's story has raised global awareness of girls ' education , a cause she has championed for years . and now that she 's out of the hospital and back in school , she is determined to keep fighting for equality . she will be speaking at the @entity27 this summer , and her memoir is set to be published later this year . " @entity31 has given me this new life , " she said in february , her first public statement since the shooting . " i want to serve the people . i want every girl , every child , to be educated . " worldwide , there are 66 million girls out of school , according to @entity38 -- many more than boys , who do n't have to face the same discrimination and obstacles that girls do in some countries . after hearing of @entity1 's shooting , however , more people have become aware of the disparity and joined her fight . three million people across the world signed the " i am @entity1 " petition to demand universal girls ' education . world leaders and celebrities such as @entity56 and @entity57 have voiced their support and helped raise money for the cause . and in @entity9 , there have been rallies and calls for change . " it seems that @entity1 's courage has awoken @entity9 's silent majority who are no longer prepared to tolerate the threats and intimidations of the @entity9 @entity4 , " said former @entity66 prime minister @entity65 , a @entity27 special envoy for global education . @entity1 's crusade started years before the shooting , when she started writing a blog for the @entity77 about life in @entity9 's conservative @entity79 . her father , @entity80 , continued to operated a school there despite a @entity4 edict that girls in the region are banned from getting an education . in her blog , @entity1 talked openly about the challenges and fears and threats her family faced . at first , she wrote anonymously , but she eventually became a public figure , giving on - camera interviews with @entity0 and other news outlets . " i have the right of education , " she said in a 2011 interview with @entity0 . " i have the right to play . i have the right to sing . i have the right to talk . i have the right to go to market . i have the right to speak up . " the media attention drew the ire of the @entity4 , which says it was behind @entity1 's shooting in october . she was riding home in a van with some of her schoolmates when masked men stopped the vehicle and demanded to know which one of them was @entity1 . when @entity1 was identified , the men opened fire on her and two other girls , both of whom also survived their injuries . " we do not tolerate people like @entity1 speaking against us , " a @entity4 spokesman said after the shooting . @entity1 was critically injured in the attack , but she suffered no permanent brain injuries . she underwent several successful surgeries in @entity9 and the @entity66 , where she now lives after her father was given a job with the @entity122 . in march , she went back to school for the first time since the attack , attending an all - girls high school in @entity126 , @entity127 . and while she recovers from her injuries , she is continuing to raise awareness and money for education . last month , she announced a $ 45,000 grant to a fund that was set up in her name -- and the first to benefit will be girls from the @entity79 . " we are going to educate 40 girls , and i invite all of you to support the @entity142 , " @entity1 said in a video that was played at the @entity137 in @entity138 . " let us turn the education of 40 girls into 40 million girls . " @entity57 , a @entity27 special envoy , will be donating $ 200,000 to the @entity142 , according to @entity137 . the fund was set up by the @entity146 , a nongovernmental organization founded in 1997 by @entity147 . " in parts of the @entity153 subcontinent , @entity154 and @entity155 , intimidation and violence are the daily reality of life for many girls who want to go to school and the many educators who want to teach them , " @entity65 wrote in a recent op - ed for @entity0 . " even today , five months after @entity1 's shooting in the @entity79 , her school friends remain in fear of violence simply for attempting to return to school . " on july 12 , her 16th birthday , @entity1 will speak to the @entity27 about the issue . since her shooting , she has become the face of girls ' education , a global symbol . she has been nominated for the @entity174 , and last year she was selected as a runner - up for @entity177 's @entity176 . " she is the daughter of the whole world , " her father told @entity0 . " the world owns her . " more : @entity181 @entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .

she is now attending school in the @entity66 ; in july , she will speak at the @placeholder
